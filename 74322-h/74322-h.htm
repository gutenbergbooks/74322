<p>The reason of the translation of this book, is the same
that actuated the Author of the original work,—not the glorification
of a particular creed, but the inculcation of a lesson
from the pages of history, whereby the reader may learn the
expediency, as well as wisdom and justness, of the great
maxim, that the fullest religious liberty is the right of all
men. The illustration of this principle, so little truly recognised,
yet happens in the present case, to bear against the
members of the Roman Catholic Church: but all creeds and
every sect may usefully perpend the moral of the narrative.
To preach the duty of toleration to the members of the
Reformed communions, whose chief dogma is the right of
private judgment, might seem a supererogatory labour, did we
not know how, in time, the best of causes may become corrupted
by the mingling of the passions, until the fair tree is
stifled under the baneful embrace of the insidious parasite.
The necessity, then, of a frequent recurrence to first principles
is obvious; and in no case can this necessity be so
strong as in religious matters. To dissent from a dominant
creed, has been hitherto to draw down persecution; and
persecution will assuredly kindle a retaliative spirit of
dogmatical oppression in the persecuted, unless these last
continually bear in mind that the very ground of their
difference was, in the outset, the privilege of thinking for
themselves. Let us, then, guard ourselves against this error,
still more deserving of reprobation in Protestants than
in Romanists; and let these finally convince themselves how
futile it is to struggle against the onward progress of the
human mind, daily absorbing more essentially the Christian
spirit, and thereby strengthening to the task of social
improvement under the advancing banner of mental independence.</p>

<p>If history is philosophy teaching by examples, a work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
that shall contribute in any degree to elucidate our views
respecting the men and manners of past ages, will certainly
be received as a desirable contribution to the general stock
of knowledge. But at a period when Europe is yet throbbing
with the repressed, not extinguished, throes of an almost
universal convulsion, a narrative of the events of an often
deeply-disturbed period, frequently offering somewhat similar
features, must prove more than ordinarily acceptable. It is
true, that a hasty glance at the passing history of European
politics fills us with only a confused sentiment of conflicting
forces, that seem to attract and repel the special atoms
hither and thither with restless disorder; yet an attentive
examination will not fail to show us that, influencing each
vortex, and dominating over every other power, are the two
antagonists that since the time of Luther have found a more
equal battle-field,—the spirit of Reform, and the spirit of the
Papacy. The nature of the struggle, in which the human
race is engaged, is in the main the same now as when the
Augustine <ins class="corr" id="tn-iv" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'monk of Wittemberg'">
monk of Wittenberg</ins> first reared the standard of
the Reformation. In the organic revolts of every community
of men, the actual principle contended for is that of
freedom of thought, and the real foes are the partisans of
priestly domination. Through all ages the sacerdotal order
have ever been the avowed or hidden opponents of all
authority that does not originate with themselves, and the
inveterate obstinacy the Roman hierarchy has displayed
in promoting and establishing the supremacy of the Papal
Church springs, as the unbroken tale of the Holy See demonstrates,
from the determination to grasp at the most absolute
temporal power. Claiming to be “lords over God’s heritage,”
they deny all right of self-action, and only tolerate kings
themselves as the tools of the universal despotism, to which
they aspire. Even the enlightened and excellent men in their
own ranks have been the foremost persecuted, and perhaps
the most striking condemnation of the governmental system
of the Papal Church is, that nearly all the great ecclesiastical
reformers have been originally Romish priests themselves.
If the bishop of Rome were only a spiritual head of a simple
church organization, who can doubt that the great mass of the
(Roman) Catholic clergy would gain immensely by the change,
both in outward moral authority and internal discipline?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p>Nowhere is this arrogant assumption of a right to sole
rule better seen than in this History of Protestantism in
France; and nowhere has the resolution to attain the end
been more unrelentingly pursued. To what extent a bigoted
system will lead its followers, the early persecutions of the
old Albigenses will show; but the renewal of the slaughter
upon the inoffensive and industrious Vaudois for their adhesion
to the cause of the Reformation, marks what little progress
the Vatican, at whose instance it was perpetrated, had
made in those Christian principles, of which it assumes to
be the only veritable exponent: while the persecutions
inflicted upon the Protestants of France, in order to force
them back into the Romish Church, continued in one form
or another down to this very day, amply prove how vain it
is to expect that the Church of Rome will ever abandon the
notion of universal empire, that has always been its dream
and aspiration.</p>

<p>But although the incarnation of ambitious priestcraft is
to be found in the prince-prelates of the Holy See, the
ministry of nearly every religious community is obnoxious
to the charge in a greater or less degree as its constitution
liberates it from the control of the laity. That this was the
conviction of the early leaders of the Reformation is evident
from the organization of their respective churches; and that
the leaven has tainted the majority of the Protestant clergy
of France is shown by their preference to be salaried by the
State rather than to be free to recur to the independence of
the admirable scheme of connexional union propounded by
Calvin. The ultimate right and equality of the People, who
form the brotherhood of Christians, is an essential principle
of a Reformed Church, and the contrary practice has more
retarded the spread of Protestantism than any other cause.
To use the expression of M. Félice respecting the Reformed
Churches of France, it would be unjust to lay the whole
blame of the disasters of religion upon the enemies of the
Reformation; the Protestants themselves must bear their
due proportion. Like the Established Church of England
and like the Wesleyan Connexion, the Reformed communion
of France is most threatened with loss from this
quarter, and if one or the other fail in that energy and
earnestness, which respectively characterized them in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
beginning, it is to be attributable to their departure from the
administrative institutions of the primitive Christians. The
modern French Protestants may well deplore the sincere
faith and fervid zeal of the early Calvinists, which re-acting
upon their whole nature, rendered them as remarkable for
their superiority in secular matters as in religious piety. If
one were disposed to speculate upon the probable destinies of
nations, and had certain events not happened, our imagination
might picture a very different France in the present era;
thus, had Henri-Quatre not apostatized, it is possible that
the Huguenot party might have triumphed in the end; had
the last siege of La Rochelle been delayed for two or three
years, until a less doubtful friend of the new faith than our
Charles I. wielded the power of England, the whole history
of France for the last two centuries might have been changed;
the principle of local self-government and strong political
action, engendered by the efforts of the Huguenots to protect
their liberties, would most probably have made France one
of the freeëst nations of the world, have saved it from all
its ruinous Revolutions, and possibly have given a wholly
different aspect to the face of southern Europe.</p>

<p>Such was not, however, destined to be the fate of the
Reformation in France, and far from being the arbiters of
the fortunes of their native land, and the regenerators of
Italy and Spain, the Reformed people have been reduced to
become humble suitors to the State for an eleemosynary
pittance to support their pastors. We cannot doubt that
their condition will ultimately improve; for to hesitate to
believe this, would be to fear for the progress of the human
mind; but the present aspect of affairs is not promising.
The establishment of the Empire, and the alliance of its chief
with the Vatican, have, indeed, no semblance of fixity; yet
the connection between absolutism and the <i lang="fr">parti prêtre</i> is so
intimate, that it is to be dreaded serious discouragement will
be offered to the Protestants. The law respecting political
assemblies affords a convenient pretext for preventing the
institution of new churches, and even for closing old ones,
which might be made available against the Reformed congregations
throughout the whole breadth of the land.</p>

<p>The principles of the Reformation have, in reality, raised
a terror in the minds of the advocates of irresponsible government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
that will not be allayed, and we ought to awaken to
the fact, that the causes of political and religious liberty are
identical on the continent as in this country. Nevertheless,
the present anomalous position of the Vatican cannot
endure; but whether the support of popedom by the soldiery
of Louis Napoleon be of short or long continuance, the
effects must still be disastrous to the cause of the Papacy.
The <i lang="fr">prestige</i> of the Church of Rome daily wanes under such
a sinister influence, and even the most zealous of her followers
must question the propriety of an empire that cannot subsist
without the aid of foreign bayonets, and has so little
succeeded, even with all the authority of a paternal rule,
often exercised by those whom she honours as saints, in
gaining the affections of the people, that were it not for the
sovereigns of the worst-governed nations in Europe,—Austria,
the Sicilies, Spain, and France,—they would rise <i lang="fr">en masse</i>
against it. It is in Italy, therefore, that the great blow will
be struck against the mental enslavement of the human
race; and not until the bishop of Rome shall be reduced to
his mere spiritual office, and himself and his court of cardinals
be shorn of that mundane supremacy, which Jesus expressly
denied to the disciples, saying, “Ye know that the princes
of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that
are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not
be so among you,”—not until then will the consummation
so devoutly to be wished for arrive.</p>

<p>That the late heroic rebellion of the Romans against the
ecclesiastical tyranny under which they groan failed, although
narrowly, of success, is to be regretted as a just revolt against
an usurpation opposed alike to the injunctions of the Christian
religion and to the dearest liberties of mankind. It is
a consolation to believe that even as the fall of the Papacy
was stayed by the hand of the most unscrupulous of mock
believers, whom yet Pius IX. styles the very dear son of the
Church (<i lang="la">carissimus in Christo filius noster</i>), it is only the
brute power of material force that retains the pontiff on his
tottering throne. The saying of the ancient king, that
“Rome is to be fought in Rome,” has already had its purport
illustrated. It is our blame that, sanctioning for
worldly motives the interference of one people with another,
when an open declaration that we will not suffer to be exercised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
on other nations that oppression we would repel, if
attempted upon ourselves, would have averted and might
still in other cases prevent the occasion altogether,—yes, it
is a reproach to us that we have shared in the crime of
having prolonged the despotism that darkens the lot of the
fairest portion of the continent and millions of our fellow-beings,
for whom may yet be in store,—and perchance also
for ourselves,—the renewal of the worst crimes of spiritual
despotism which this book records, and another instance of
<em>the great fact</em> that Rome, in its intents and purposes, is, and
ever will be, to the hour of its accomplished doom—<span class="smcap">Semper
eadem!</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak lsp2" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r10">

<p>This work was first sketched out several years ago. Different
circumstances, and latterly, the general pre-occupation
of the country, have prevented the author from completing
it sooner. The same causes will explain why he has comprised
in a single volume a history which, if it were fully
developed, would require several.</p>

<p>The book was, at the commencement, framed on a much
more extensive plan. But the present epoch, with its uncertainties
and its apprehensions, is unfavourable to lengthy
undertakings. Hence all that will be found herein, is a simple
abridgment of the rich and varied annals of the French
Reformation.</p>

<p>To gain space, the indication of the sources applied to,
has been reduced to the narrowest limit. It would have
been easy to fill entire pages with what the Germans call
the <i lang="fr">littérature</i> of the subject. But these bibliographical
details, while they must have occupied much room, would have
been useful to the learned by profession alone, who do not
require them; therefore, it is only when we have borrowed
his own words from an author, or when we have related
events, subject to controversy, that it has appeared necessary
to cite our authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>The general histories of France, which we may suppose to
be familiar to most of our readers, have also afforded an
opportunity of abridging our own. A few words have
sufficed for whatever may be found everywhere, such as
the wars of Protestantism in the sixteenth century, the
intrigues of party, and court influences mixed up with
religious struggles. To explain the succession of events,
something of all this had to be told, but the simplest narration
was all that could be required. The essential for us,
was precisely that which other historians neglect to relate—the
development, the life, the internal successes and reverses
of the Reformed people. Instead of taking our point of
observation without, we have chosen it from within. Here,
indeed, is the <em>special</em> History of Protestantism, in which our
literature was deficient.</p>

<p>Each one of the periods of the French Reformation has been
treated, it is true, by ancient or recent writers; but there
exists in our language no work that exhibits a condensed
and altogether regular view of this history. There was,
then, a void to fill up. We have undertaken the task, and
we hope that this book, defective as it may be, will at
least give some just idea of the affairs and the men of the
Reformed communion of France.</p>

<p>It is sad to think how little the history of the Protestants
is known in their own country, and even, it must be confessed,
among the members of their own churches. Yet it
offers chosen intellects and noble spirits for contemplation,
great examples for imitation, and precious lessons to be
gathered.</p>

<p>Protestantism has suffered from national opinion the fate
of minorities, and of vanquished minorities. When it ceased
to be feared, it ceased to be known, and under the favour of
this disregard and indifference, every kind of prejudice
against it has been received and believed. This is a denial
of justice, which it ought not to accept, and a misfortune,
from which it ought to relieve itself. History is the common
property of all.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we treat here of only one of the two branches
of French Protestantism. The Lutherans of Alsatia, or Christians
of the Confession of Augsburg, annexed to our country
from the reign of Louis XIV., and who form about a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
third of the total number of the Protestants, will be
completely excluded from this book. They have a separate
origin, language, and form of worship, and although all the
disciples of the Reformation of the sixteenth century may be
united by the most intimate ties, the followers of Luther
and those of Calvin have distinct annals. The first have
already in Alsatia more than one historian of note, and it was
not for us to take a work in hand, which they are better
able to accomplish. It is, therefore, of the Reformers, properly
speaking, or of those Huguenots, whose name has so
oft resounded in the France of old, that we desire to write.</p>

<p>No spirit of sect or of system must be looked for in this
work. The latter is, perhaps, useful in a theological or a
philosophical history; it allows us to measure all events and
all opinions by one invariable standard, and to subordinate
them to a high and controlling unity; but such has not
been our design. Our office is that of a narrator rather
than of a judge, and our purpose is to tell the history, not
to make it speak in favour of a theory. One conceives that
in ecclesiastical history generally, which has been told and
re-told again and again, an author should endeavour to bring
it back to a systematic point of view; that is the only way
to give to his work a character of originality, and, so to speak,
the reason for its existence. But for the history of the
French Protestants, which has never been written as a whole,
it was first requisite to collect and arrange the facts in a
simple, clear, and impartial manner, without adopting a type,
which might have distorted their nature. Other writers
will follow who, finding these facts, will re-construct them
by means of philosophy or theology.</p>

<p>It was equally fitting that we should abstain from taking
part in the questions, which divide Protestants among
themselves. It was not for us to decide who was right
or who wrong in these matters, and our pen would have
betrayed our will, if, in the following pages, it could be
supposed that any class of opinions would find an apology,
or meet with an attack. Truth and justice are for all, as far
as it has been possible for us to discern the true and the
just: we could aspire to nothing less, and nothing more can
be required of us.</p>

<p>This impartiality is not the neutrality of indifference or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
sloth, or of what is sometimes called <em>impersonality</em>. In the
great struggles of Protestantism, we are on the side of the
oppressed against the oppressor, of the victims against their
executioners, of right against brute force, of equality against
privilege, and of liberty against despotism. The principle
of the inviolability of the human conscience, which the
peoples of modern times have gathered from the Gospel, is
ours; and we shall esteem ourselves amply rewarded for our
efforts, if the perusal of this work shall inspire, together
with the sentiment of the happy effects of the Christian life,
a deeper abhorrence of all religious persecution, under whatever
name or pretext it may seek to cloak itself.</p>

<p>Liberty of thought, liberty of faith, liberty of worship,
under the safeguard and within the limits of common right:
complete equality of religious creeds, and even above
that equality itself, charity, fraternal love, which feels for
the erring while reprobating their error—these are our
maxims. They have constantly guided us in our labours,
and God grant that our conviction may pass in its entirety
into the spirit and conscience of the reader! The generation
of our day is still in too much need of teaching of this kind.</p>

<p>It was impossible to write this book without relating from
period to period, the last excepted, deeds of frightful injustice
and of terrible cruelty; for that is the history itself
of Protestantism from its origin down to the eve of the
Revolution of 1789. No Christian population has been so
long persecuted as the Reformed people of France. The
duty of the historian must be fulfilled; but wherever the
task was painful, we have striven to extenuate, by insisting
upon the piety and perseverance of the proscribed, much
more than upon the crimes of the proscribes. In the midst
of massacres, in the face of the scaffold and the stake, in the
bloody expeditions against the gatherings in the wilderness,
we have only glanced at the oppressors, and our eyes have
dwelt upon the victims. This restraint has been of twofold
benefit to us, both as a precept of charity, and as a rule of
literary composition. Every work, which excites the mind
without elevating it, is bad.</p>

<p>The old passions, besides, must be extinguished, not only
among those whose forefathers underwent so many sufferings,
but also in the heart of the men, who at the present time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
occupy the places of the most inveterate enemies of Protestantism.
However the (Roman) Catholic clergy may declare itself
immutable in its creeds and maxims, it is to be hoped that
this immutability does not apply to the principle of persecution.
The advance of public morals has penetrated more or less
everywhere, and the sword of intolerance, which has, alas!
in disastrous days recoiled upon the priest himself, would,
doubtless, fail to find a hand to wield it again.</p>

<p>The Reformers of France never would become in their
country a Protestant Ireland. If they have too often stood
apart from the great national family, this was their misfortune—not
their fault. They did not separate themselves;
they were driven forth; and each time the door has been
opened, though it were but half way, they could, without
betraying their sacred and inviolable obligations to God, return
to the bosom of the nation, and they have done so with
joy and sincerity. Now that the civil law is the same for all,
they form in no sense, either near or afar off, a distinct political
party, and they hold it as a point of honour to be confounded
in that vast unity, which is the strength and the
glory of France.</p>

<p>Theodore de Bèze said in his day to King Henry IV.:
“My desire is, that Frenchmen should love one another.”
This wish of the venerable Reformer is that of all Protestants,
and truly, the circumstances which surround us, render
it now more than ever an imperative duty. Not that we
partake of the discouragement of many estimable men; we
confide in the love of God, in the power of His Spirit, in the
progress of the human race. Where others discover the
seeds of decay, we behold the beginnings of a new and higher
life. But the transition will be wearisome, the success difficult;
and to secure a happier lot, there must be the full
concurrence of all sincere Christians and all good citizens.</p>

<p>The Reformation of the sixteenth century is the greatest
event of modern times. It has remodelled everything in
Protestant countries; and has modified almost everything
in Roman Catholic countries—religious and moral doctrines,
ecclesiastical and civil institutions, the arts and sciences,
in such sort that it is impossible to advance a step in the
investigation of an idea, or a fact whatsoever, without meeting
this immense work face to face. The Reformation marks
the starting-point of a new world: God alone knows its
development and its end.</p>

<p>It is important to examine how, in the first years of the
sixteenth century, it arose out of the intellectual wants and
the general conscience, of mankind. It was at the same
time the expression of a profound state of uneasiness, the
means of a mighty improvement, and the pledge of a progress
towards a better future.</p>

<p>The Papacy, without doubt, had rendered more than one
service to Christianity in the barbarous ages. It would be
unjust to refuse it the honour of having served as a centre
of European unity, and of having often made right prevail
over brute force. But gradually as the peoples advanced,
Rome became less capable of leading them, and when she
dared to erect herself as an impassable barrier before the
double action of the spirit of God and the spirit of man, she
received a wound which, notwithstanding vain appearances,
widens from generation to generation.</p>

<p>In matters of belief and of worship, Roman Catholicism
had admitted, by ignorance or by design, many of the Pagan
elements. Without denying the fundamental dogmas of
Christianity, it had disfigured and mutilated them to the
extent of rendering them difficult of recognition. It was
the world, to say sooth, which, forcing <i lang="fr">en masse</i> the doors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the Christian church, had borne in with it its demigods
under the name of saints, its rites, its feasts, its consecrated
spots, its lustral water, its sacerdotal system; everything, in
fine, to the very insignia of its priests; so much so that
polytheism survived itself, in great measure, under the garb
of the religion of Christ.</p>

<p>This mass of errors and of superstitions had naturally
extended itself during the long darkness of the Middle Age.
Peoples and priests had each lent their hand. Out of the
false traditions of Catholicism some new falsehood was seen to
rise from time to time, and it is easy to mark in the history
of the Church the date of all the great changes that Christianity
has undergone. The most devoted defenders of the
papal throne confess that the corruption was extreme at the
outset of the sixteenth century. “Some years before the
appearance of the Calvinist and Lutheran heresy,” says
Bellarmine, “there existed scarcely any severity in the
ecclesiastical laws, purity in manners, learning in sacred
literature, respect for holy things, or religion.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Preaching, although very rare, contributed to thicken
the darkness, it would seem, rather than to dispel it. Bossuet
acknowledges this with precautions which but half conceal
his thoughts: “Many preachers preached only indulgences,
pilgrimages, alms to the religious orders, and made the
essence of piety to consist in these practices, which were but
its accessories. They did not speak so much as they should
have done of the grace of Jesus Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Bible was silent beneath the dust of old libraries. It
was kept in some places fastened with an iron chain; sad
image of the interdiction with which it was stricken in the
Catholic world.</p>

<p>After having forbidden it to the faithful, the clergy, by a
very simple consequence, had closed the Bible in their own
schools. A short while before the Reformation, the professors
of Germany had been prohibited from explaining the
Holy Word in their public and private lectures. The original
tongues of the Old and New Testament were, so to say,
suspected of heresy; and when Luther raised his voice, it
would have been difficult to find in the church of Rome any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
doctors capable of discussing with him the text of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>In this deep silence of the sacred authors, ignorance, prejudice,
ambition, avarice, had free speech. The priest frequently
used this liberty not for the glory of God, but of
himself; and religion, destined to transform man into the
image of his Creator, ended by transforming the Creator
himself into the image of cupidinous and intolerant man.</p>

<p>Theology, after having shone with a splendid light in the
brilliant days of scholasticism, had by degrees lost its ardour
as well as its authority, and had become an enormous collection
of curious and frivolous questions. Incessantly occupied
with sharpening in puerile disputes the point of its logic, it
no longer answered the wants of the human mind any more
than those of the human heart.</p>

<p>The masses of the people appeared to follow, in general,
their accustomed way; but from habit and tradition, rather
than from devotion. The enthusiasm of the Middle Age had
evaporated, and it would have been vain to seek in the Church
for those mighty inspirations, which caused all Europe to rise
at the time of the crusades.</p>

<p>Some pious men dwelt in the presbyteries, in the cloisters,
among the laity, striving to seize the truth through the veil
with which it had been covered; but they were scattered,
suspected, and cast down with grief.</p>

<p>Discipline had shared the alterations of doctrine. The
pontiff of Rome having, under favour of the false Decretals,
usurped the title and the functions of universal bishop, pretended
to the exercise of most of the rights which belonged,
in the first ages, to the heads of dioceses; and as he was not
ubiquitous, as he was obedient to his passions or to his interests
more than to his duties, he aggravated the abuses
which he ought to have extirpated.</p>

<p>What the sovereign pontiff was to the bishops, the mendicant
monks, the venders of indulgences, and the other
vagabond agents of the Papacy, were to the simple curates
and the parish priests. Regular and legitimate authority
was compelled to give way to these intruders, who, while
they promised to reinstate the flocks, did nothing but pervert
them.</p>

<p>All was disorder and anarchy. A despotic power was at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
summit of the Church; midway and below, were growing usurpations,
scandalous and never-ceasing contests; Christianity had
much less reason to complain of being too much governed, than
of being badly governed. Illusory in the ranks of the clergy,
discipline had actually become a source of demoralization for
the laity. To the long and severe penances of ancient times
had succeeded the redemption of sins at a money price.
If, at least, it had been necessary to pay for each transgression
separately, it would yet have been necessary to number one’s
vices. The extreme evil was, that they might be redeemed
all at once, they might be redeemed beforehand, for all one’s
lifetime, for all one’s family, for all one’s posterity, for a whole
parish altogether. Thenceforward, there was no more authority.
The absolution of the priest was derided, because absolution
had already been paid for out of the purse; and the
clerical power that Rome maintained on one side, she overthrew
on the other.</p>

<p>The traffic of indulgences was carried on by the same
means as ordinary barter; it had its contractors on a large
scale, its directors and sub-directors, its offices, its tariffs, its
travelling factors. Indulgences were vended by auction, at
the beat of the drum, in the public places. They were sold
by wholesale and by retail, and those agents were employed,
who best knew the art of deceiving and plundering mankind.</p>

<p>It was, above all, this sacrilegious industry which gave the
fatal blow to the Romish church. Nothing irritates a people
so much as to find in religion less morality than in themselves;
and this instinct is just. Every religion should
ameliorate those who believe in it. When it depraves them,
when it makes them descend beneath that condition in
which they would be without it, its fall is certain; for it possesses
no longer its essential and supreme reason of existence.</p>

<p>How, moreover, could the members of the clergy enforce
a respect for moral duties, which they were the first to
transgress? We will not here recount the disgraceful and
universal licentiousness so numerously attested by authentic
declarations, among others by the <em>hundred grievances</em> which
were presented to the diet of Nuremberg, in 1523, with the
signature of a legate even of Pope Adrian. Many priests
paid a public tax for the privilege of living in an unlawful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
commerce, and in many localities in Germany this disorder
had been rendered obligatory, so that still greater offences
might be avoided.</p>

<p>Besides indulgences, Rome had invented all kinds of
methods for increasing its revenues: appellations, reservations,
exemptions, provisions, dispensations, expectatives,
annates. The gold of Europe would have been completely
absorbed if the governments had not placed some barrier;
and even the poorest nations were compelled to impoverish
themselves yet more to gorge pontiffs, who, like the grave,
never exclaimed—“It is enough.”</p>

<p>The bishops and the heads of monastic orders did the same
in the different provinces of Catholicity. Everything helped
them to swell the possessions of the Church; peace and
war, public triumphs and misfortunes, private successes and
reverses, the faith of these, and the heresy of those. What
they could not obtain from the liberality of the faithful,
they sought in the spoliation of those who disbelieved. And
so, as the grievances of Nuremberg state, the regular and
secular clergy possessed in Germany one-half the territory;
in France it held the third; elsewhere, still more. And
the ecclesiastical domains being exempt from all taxation,
priests and monks, without bearing the burdens of the state,
monopolized all its benefits.</p>

<p>Not only did they enjoy enormous privileges for their
property; they had others for their persons. Every clerk
was an anointed of the Lord, a sacred thing for the civil
judge. No one had a right to place his hand upon him,
until he had been tried, condemned, and degraded by the
members of his own order. The clergy thus formed a
society wholly distinct from the general society. It was a
caste placed without and above the common law; its immunities
prevailed over the sovereignty of justice, and authors
entitled to our credence relate that wretches entered the
sacerdotal order or the cloister, solely to commit crimes with
impunity.</p>

<p>If the priests did not suffer the magistrates to attach them,
they arrogated to themselves the right of interposing without
end in the suits of the laity. Testaments and wills,
marriages, the civil condition of children, and a host of
other matters which were called mixed, were carried before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
their tribunal; so that a considerable part of justice depended
upon the clergy, who themselves depended upon their peers
and chief alone; an organization, useful perhaps in the times
of ignorance, when none but ecclesiastics possessed any
knowledge, but which, by perpetuating itself down to the
sixteenth century, after the revival of letters, became the
most iniquitous of prerogatives, the most intolerable of
usurpations.</p>

<p>There are in the present day writers who draw a magnificent
ideal of the state of Catholicism before Luther. But
have they ever studied that epoch? And those who declaim
with the greatest violence against the Reformation, would
they suffer for one day the abuses it has destroyed?</p>

<p>And it must be said, for the honour of mankind, that
from period to period, fresh and courageous adversaries have
arisen against each error, and each encroachment of the
priestly power. In an early age, Vigilantius, and Claude of
Turin; then, the Vaudois and the Albigenses; then, the
Wickliffites, the Hussites, and the Brethren of Moravia and
Bohemia—small and feeble communities—were crushed by
the popes leagued with the princes, but who from their scaffolds
and their stakes, transmitted to each other the sacred flame
of primitive faith, until, reared aloft by the powerful hand of
Luther, it spread afar its rays over the Christian world.</p>

<p>Another protestation, parallel to the preceding, and which
has been styled Catholic Protestantism, had constantly manifested
itself in the bosom of the Church itself, particularly
after the appearance of the mystics of the Middle Age.
Among the theologians, Bernard de Clairvaux, Gerson
d’Ailly, Nicholas de Clémangis; among the poets, Dante
and Petrarch; even councils held at Pisa, Constance, and
Basle; men the most renowned for their piety and their
character, for their genius and their learning, had raised the
same cry: “A reform, a reform in the Church! A reform in
the head and the members, in the faith and the manners!”
But this Catholic movement always failed; because it never
attacked the root of the evil. The secret of obtaining all—is
it not that of desiring and daring all?</p>

<p>Whilst the Papacy persecuted the former of these protestations,
and tried to seduce the other, a new enemy presented
itself: the most redoubtable of all, because it could assume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the most diverse forms; because it displayed itself everywhere
at the same moment; because neither artifices nor tortures
could subdue it. And what was this antagonist?—The human
mind itself awakening from its long sleep. The fifteenth
century had restored to it the books of antiquity. It suddenly
felt itself animated with an intense want of investigation
and renewal; and resuming, at the same time, philosophy,
history, poetry, the sciences, the arts, all the wonders of the
most flourishing ages of Greece and ancient Rome, it was
aware that it could and would march onward in its independence.</p>

<p>The discovery of printing came to help the revival of learning.
The old world reappeared in its entirety at the same
time that Christopher Columbus discovered a new one. More
than three thousand writings were published from the year
1450 to the year 1520. There was a prodigious activity,
which knew neither fatigue nor fear; and what could the
Church oppose to this first expansion of the human mind, so
happy and so proud of entering again upon the possession of
itself? The martyrdom of Savonarola did not intimidate it;
at the most it took a by-turn in the treatises of Pomponatius,
to arrive at the same end. The Vatican, which had sometimes
been so skilful, was not so in the face of this vast
movement. Several popes succeeded each other, feeble, or
covetous of money, or stained with the foulest crimes:
Paul II., Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII., Alexander VI.,
Julius II. The last, Leo X., having the voluptuous tastes of
the race of the Medici, to which he belonged, without sharing
their grandeur or their courage,—a priest without theological
learning, a pontiff without gravity, setting his buffoons to dispute
about the immortality of the soul, and amusing himself
with the frivolous diversions of the theatre, when Germany
was on fire,—seems to have been chosen from on high to level
the path of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Thus everything was ready. Scarcely do we place our foot
upon the threshold of the sixteenth century, before we hear
those hollow sounds which, in the moral world, as in the
physical, announce the approach of the storm. The heart is
oppressed, the mind is disturbed: something extraordinary,
we know not what, is about to happen. Kings upon their
thrones, the learned in their closets, professors in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
chairs, pious men in their oratories, even warriors upon the
field of battle, tremble and reveal, by brief words or acts of
violence, the presentiments which pursue them.</p>

<p>In 1511, the emperor Maximilian and the king Louis XII.
convoke a council at Pisa, in order to recall Julius II. to his
duty, and to remedy the evils of the Church. Several cardinals
attend, in spite of the prohibitions of the Vatican;
and on the 21st of April, 1512, the pope Julius is suspended,
as notoriously incorrigible and contumacious. “Arise, Cæsar,”
write with one accord the members of this assembly to the
emperor Maximilian: “Arise, be firm and watchful; the
Church falls; the good are oppressed; and the wicked
triumph.”</p>

<p>Julius II. opposed council with council, and assembled in
the basilic of the Lateran the prelates who remained faithful
to him. But even there, before this pontiff, who possessed
no other knowledge than that of arms, Œgidius de Viterbo,
general of the order of the Augustines, accuses the priests of
having abandoned prayer for the sword, and of haunting,
after battle, houses of prostitution. “Can we contemplate,”
he asks, “without shedding tears of blood, the ignorance, the
ambition, the immodesty, the impiety reigning in the holy
places, whence they ought to be for ever banished?”</p>

<p>As they hearkened to these cries of distress descending from
such high places, the troubled nations appealed to a new general
council, as if experience had not taught them that these great
assemblies, so prodigal of words, were barren for a work of
reformation! But the multitude knew not whence deliverance
might come, and, in its anxiety, it clung to the illusions of its
old recollections.</p>

<p>In the midst of this universal and restless expectation,
the enemy grew bold. Reuchlin maintained the rights of
knowledge against the barbarous teaching of the universities.
The noble Ulrich of Hutten, the representative of chivalry
in this grand struggle, announced by appeals from the sword
to public reason, the advent of a new civilization. Erasmus,
the Voltaire of the epoch, excited the laughter of kings,
lords, cardinals, and even the pope, at the expense of the
monks and doctors, and opened the door by which the modern
world must pass. Then Martin Luther appeared.</p>

<p>It is not part of my task to write the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Reformer. Sent to Rome respecting the affairs of the order of
the Augustines, he found there a vast and profound incredulity,
a revolting immorality. Luther returned to Germany
heartbroken, his conscience agitated with bitter doubts. An
old Bible, which he discovered in the convent of Erfurt, revealed
to him a religion wholly different from that which he had
been taught. Still the thought was not yet born within him
to undertake the reformation of the Church. Pastor and
professor at Wittenberg, he confined himself to spreading
around him healthy doctrines and good examples.</p>

<p>But John Tetzel, a vender of indulgences, audacious to
effrontery, covetous to cynicism, whilom condemned to
prison for notorious crimes, and menaced with drowning in
the Inn by the inhabitants of the Tyrol, dared to interpose
his vile traffic between the word of Luther and the souls
confided to him. Luther became indignant: he re-perused
his Bible; and in 1517 he affixed to the door of the cathedral
of Wittenberg those ninety-five theses destined soon to
raise throughout all Europe such a formidable echo.</p>

<p>It was the revolt of his conscience, which made him seek
in the Bible fresh weapons against the church of Rome. It
is the same moral revolt, which will gather around him thousands,
and soon millions of disciples. Luther has placed
himself at the head of all the irritated people of worth.</p>

<p>To the dogma of justification by works, which has produced
so many extravagant practices and shameful excesses,
he opposes justification through faith in the redemption
of Jesus Christ. All his doctrine is summed up in these
words of the apostle Paul: “For by grace are ye saved
through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This doctrine had the double advantage of resting
for support upon Biblical texts, and of overthrowing by the
same blow indulgences, supererogatory works of saints, pilgrimages,
flagellations, penances, artificial merits. It thus
accorded with the highest ideas, with the best religions, the
intellectual and moral aspirations of the era.</p>

<p>Luther had taken a first step. He again appealed, nevertheless,
from the pope ill-informed, to the pope better advised.
But instead of an ordinance of reformation, Rome sent a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
bull of excommunication. The doctor of Wittenberg solemnly
burnt it, with the Decretals of the Holy See, on the
10th of December, 1520, in the presence of innumerable
spectators. The issuing flame lighted up all Europe, and
cast a sinister glare upon the walls of the Vatican.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, 1521, Luther appeared before the
diet of Worms. He had against him the emperor and the
pope, the two greatest powers of the universe; but he had
for him the living forces of his age. When he was summoned
to retract, he invoked the testimony of the Bible. If he were
convicted of error by that, he would recant; if not, no! The
envoy of Rome refused to open the book which condemned
the papacy, and Charles V. began to perceive that there
is here below something superior to the power of the
sword.</p>

<p>The work advanced. It is interesting to observe that
Luther did not arrive with a system complete and defined.
He came with a first grievance against the abuses of the
Romish church, then with a second; with one hand upsetting
by degrees the old edifice of Catholicism, whilst with the
other he constructed the new edifice; he did not himself
apprehend the extent of his mission but as he gradually
fulfilled it.</p>

<p>After the upraising of his conscience, came the reordering
of doctrine; after doctrine, the reform of worship; after worship,
the establishment of new ecclesiastical institutions.
Luther never went beyond his convictions, or outstepped
the movement of public opinion. It was thus that he retained
under his standard those who had gathered around it,
and that he was aided in his labour by the public thought.
Luther gave much to the contemporaneous generation, and
perhaps received yet more than he gave.</p>

<p>One of his most laborious and useful works was the translation
of the Bible into German. It fixed the language of
his country, and made stable its faith.</p>

<p>Eight years after the publication of <ins class="corr" id="tn-10" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the ninety-nine theses'">
the ninety-five theses</ins>, in 1525, Luther espoused Catherine de Bora, being persuaded,
with Æneas Sylvius, who became pope under the name
of Pius II., that if there are many strong reasons for interdicting
priests from marrying, there are some much stronger
for permitting it. In the performance of this solemn act,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the Reformer equally avoided a precipitation which might
have compromised his character, and a delay which might
have degenerated or weakened his maxims. He was then
forty-two years of age, and on the avowal of his opponents
themselves, “he had spent all his youth without reproach, in
continence.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1530, Melancthon, the fellow-labourer of Luther, presented
to the diet of Augsburg, with his accord, the Confession
of Faith, which, during ages, has served as a rallying-point
to the Lutheran reformation. The Protestants showed
in this way, that they had shaken off the yoke of Rome
only to accept, without reservation, the injunctions of the
Bible, such at least as they understood them according to
the measure of the intelligence of their time.</p>

<p>There were manifest and sore trials in the life of Luther:
the excesses of the Anabaptists, the insurrection of the peasants,
the passions of the princes, who mingled with religious
questions political calculations; the over-zeal of some of his
followers, the weakness and timidity of many others. He
was often grieved, never cast down; for the same spirit of
faith which had opened to him the road, led him along it
with unswerving constancy.</p>

<p>Luther died in 1546. Some hours before his end, he
said: “Jonas, Cælius, and you who are present, pray for the
cause of God and of his Gospel; for the council of Trent
and the pope rage furiously.” And when the cold sweat
seized him, he began to pray in these terms: “O my beloved
Father in heaven, God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
God of all comfort, I thank thee that thou hast revealed to
me thy dear Son Jesus Christ, in whom I believe, whom I
have preached and confessed, whom I have loved and glorified.
I pray thee, Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on my
poor soul.” Then he repeated thrice in Latin: “Father, I
return my spirit into thy hands. Thou hast redeemed me,
O Eternal God of truth.” Then, without agony, without
effort, he breathed his last.</p>

<p>While the Reformation changed the face of Germany, it
penetrated also into the mountains and the valleys of Switzerland.
It had even appeared there before. Ulrich Zwinglius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
was encouraged and fortified by the words of Luther, but he
had not waited for them. “I began to preach the Gospel in
the year of grace 1516,” he wrote; “that is to say, when the
name of Luther had not yet been pronounced in our country.
It is not from Luther I have learned the doctrine of Christ;
it is from the Word of God.”</p>

<p>Another seller of indulgences, Bernardine Samson, drove
Zwinglius, in 1518, to declare himself openly. Ever, we see,
the rebellion of conscience against the disorders of Catholic
authority. The Reformation was a protestation of outraged
morality, before it was a religious revival.</p>

<p>This unfrocked Carmelite had brought from Italy an impudence
which provoked the indignation of vice itself. “I
can pardon every sin,” he cried; “heaven and hell are submitted
to my power, and I sell the favours of Jesus Christ
to whomsoever will buy them for ready money.” He boasted
of having carried off enormous sums from a poor country.
When there was a lack of coin, he took in exchange for his
papal bulls, plate of silver and gold. He made his acolytes
shout to the multitude that pressed around his stalls:
“Hinder not each other. Let those come first who have
money; we will try afterwards to content those who have
none.”</p>

<p>Ulrich Zwinglius, from that time, attacked the power of
the pope, the penitential sacrament, the merit of ceremonial
works, the sacrifice of the Mass, abstinence from flesh, the
celibacy of priests; gradually growing more firm and more
decided as the public voice answered his with increasing
energy.</p>

<p>The Swiss Reformer was modest, affable, popular, and of
irreproachable life. He had a profound knowledge of the
Scriptures, a living faith, a solid erudition, clear ideas, a
simple and precise language, an activity without limit.
Stored with the Greek and Roman literature, and full of
admiration for the great men of antiquity, he had some
opinions which appeared novel and over-bold in his time.
Zwinglius admitted, like many of the old fathers of the
Church, the permanent and universal action of the divine
spirit on humanity. “Plato,” said he, “also drank of the
divine fountain: and if the two Catos, if Camillus and Scipio,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
had not been truly religious, would they have been so magnanimous?”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Called to Zurich, he taught there, not what he had received
from the Romish tradition, but what he had gathered from
the Bible. “This is the preacher of truth,” said he to the
magistrates; “it announces to you things as they are.” And
from the year 1520, the council of Zurich published an
ordinance, enjoining upon their ecclesiastics not to preach
anything which was not found in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Three years after, Pope Adrian, seeing the growing authority
of Zwinglius, endeavoured to gain him over. He sent him
a letter, in which he complimented him upon his excellent
virtues, and directed his legate to offer him <em>everything short
of the pontifical throne</em>. Adrian knew the worth of the man,
not his character. At the very moment when such high
dignities were offered to him, Zwinglius was victoriously
disputing at Zurich against the delegates of the bishop of
Constance.</p>

<p>Other debates were commenced in the presence of the
magistrates and of the people. At last, on the 12th of
April, 1525, an ordinance for abolishing the Mass and celebrating
the communion according to the simplicity of the
Gospel appeared.</p>

<p>The difference of the age and manners should be noticed
here. In the sixteenth century, the civil power decided
upon the change of religion; in the nineteenth century this
would be thought an intolerable usurpation. As civilization
advances, it gradually diminishes, in spiritual matters, the
authority of the state, and increases that of the individual.</p>

<p>The Helvetic cantons having taken different sides, some
that of Rome, others that of the Reformation, a war of religion,
the worst of all wars, broke out among them. It was
an ancient custom for the chief pastor of Zurich to accompany
the army. Zwinglius conformed to the practice. The
historian Ruchat relates that he marched as if he were
conducted to death, and that those who watched his demeanour
observed that he ceased not to pray to God to guard
in safe-keeping his soul and the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>On the 11th of October, 1531, he was struck down on the
battle-field of Cappel. He regained his feet, but, pressed by
the crowd of fugitives, he thrice fell. “Alas, what misfortune
is this?” he cried. “Well! they may kill the body,
but they cannot slay the soul.” These were the last words
he could articulate. Stretched upon his back, with joined
hands, and eyes bent on heaven, the motion of his lips alone
showed that he prayed. Some soldiers having lifted him up
without knowing who he was, asked if he wished to confess,
and invoke the Virgin and the saints. He indicated his
dissent by a sign of the head, and upraising his eyes, continued
his silent prayers. “<em>It is an obstinate heretic!</em>”
shouted the soldiers, and an officer stabbing him in the throat
with a pike, put an end to his existence. According to
some, Ulrich Zwinglius was forty-four years of age; according
to others, forty-seven.</p>

<p>Many different judgments have been passed upon this
tragic end, and we may still see in them the change of
opinions. Our times would, at least, deplore the death of a
minister of the Gospel in the midst of a scene of carnage:
such was not the manner of thinking three centuries ago.
“Discharging the duties of his ministry in the army, Zwinglius,”
says Theodore de Bèze, “was slain in battle, and his
body was burnt by the enemy: God thus honouring his servant
with a double crown, seeing that a man could not die
after a more honourable and more holy fashion, than by
losing this corruptible life for the safety of his country, and
for the glory of God.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In spite of checks of more than one kind, the Reformation
spread rapidly throughout a great part of Europe, and
took root.</p>

<p>In Germany, Saxony, Hesse, Brandenburg, the Palatinate,
Pomerania, many secondary states, and nearly all the free
towns; in the east, the majority of the population of Hungary;
in the north, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and a part
of Poland, burst asunder the chains of Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p>In England and Scotland, two distinct movements led
the people to the Protestant faith: one guided by King
Henry VIII., the other by the pastor John Knox. Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the diversity of principles and organization subsisting at the
present day.</p>

<p>The Reformation penetrated into the heart of Europe,
but could not establish itself. In Spain, the long struggle
with the Moors had identified Catholicism with the national
mind, and the Inquisition stood firm, supported by popular
fanaticism. In Italy, the scepticism of the learned, the
countless ramifications of the clergy, the interests of a multitude
of families engaged in the maintenance of the old
ecclesiastical order, the passion of the masses for the fine
arts, and the pomp of the Romish worship, hindered the
progress of Protestantism.</p>

<p>At the gates of France, Switzerland, on one side, with a
few small bordering states, Alsace, Lorraine, the country of
Montbéliard, which have since become French provinces; and
on the other side, Flanders and Holland, listened with sympathy
to the preaching of the new ideas. Thus the Reformation
spread around all the frontiers of France, while it strove to
penetrate and overrun it within.</p>

<p>We reach at length the history, which forms the subject of
this book. It will place before our eyes great triumphs followed
by great catastrophes, and fearful persecutions, only
to be surpassed by the constancy of the victims. It is, altogether,
one of the most important chapters in the annals of
the French nation, and one of the most interesting pages of
the Reformation.</p>

<span class="fs60">FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE TO THE
OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE OF POISSY.<br>

(1521-1561.)</span></h2>

<h3 id="BI_I">I.</h3>

<p>Meaux was the first town in France that heard the doctrines
of the Reformation publicly expounded. This was in
1521, four years after Luther had affixed his theses against
indulgences upon the doors of his cathedral, and the very
year in which he appeared before the diet of Worms.</p>

<p>Two preachers attracted, beyond all others, the attention
of the inhabitants of Meaux: Jacques Lefevre and Guillaume
Farel; the one aged nearly seventy, but still full of activity
in a green old age; the other, young, decided, ardent, and,
according to the testimony of his contemporaries, making
the public places and the temples resound with a voice of
thunder.</p>

<p>Jacques Lefevre was born at Etaples, a small town of Picardy.
Endowed with an expansive and inquiring mind, he had embraced
all things in his studies,—the ancient tongues, <i lang="fr">belles
lettres</i>, history, mathematics, philosophy, theology; and in
the course of his long travels, he had acquired everything
that could be learned at the end of the fifteenth century.
On his return to France, he was nominated to a professorship
in the university of Paris, and gathered round his chair
a numerous body of scholars. The doctors of the Sorbonne,
distrustful of his learning, and jealous of his reputation,
watched him with a hostile eye. Yet he displayed great
devotion, being one of the most assiduous at mass, and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
processions, passing whole hours at the foot of the images of
Mary, and delighting in adorning them with flowers.</p>

<p>Lefevre had even undertaken to rewrite the Legend of the
Saints, but he did not reach the end; for having attentively
read the Bible to complete his work, he discovered that the
holiness of most of the heroes of the Roman calendar bears
but very little resemblance to the ideal of Christian virtue.
Once on this new ground, he never quitted it; and always
as sincere with his students as with his conscience, he openly
attacked some of the errors of the (Roman) Catholic Church.
To the justification of outward works he opposed justification
by faith, and announced the advent of a new birth in
the religion of the people. This happened in 1512.</p>

<p>It is important to notice these dates, because they prove
that the notions of reform, not only in worship, or in discipline,
but in the very fundamental principles, manifested
themselves at the same time in several places, without its
being possible that the men, who put themselves at the head
of the movement, could have acted in concert. When a
political or religious revolution is ripe, it appears on all sides,
and no one can say who was the first to move in it.</p>

<p>Among those who heard the new opinions of Jacques Lefevre
with avidity, was Guillaume Farel, whom we have already
named. Born near Gap in 1489, and instructed in the faithful
observance of devout practices, he had sought in them,
like his master, peace of heart. Night and day, as he
has himself related it in a confession addressed <em>to all lords
and peoples</em>, he invoked the Virgin and the saints; he scrupulously
conformed to the fasts prescribed by the Church,
held the pontiff of Rome to be a god upon earth, saw in the
priests the sole channel of all celestial blessings, and treated
as infidels whoever did not exhibit an ardour similar to his
own.</p>

<p>When he heard his venerated master teach that these
practices were of small avail, and that salvation comes from
faith in Jesus Christ, he experienced a deep agitation. The
combat was long and terrible. On one side were the lessons
and the habits of his home, so many recollections, so many
prayers, so many hopes! On the other, the declarations of
the Bible, the duty of subjecting everything to the search
after truth, the promise of everlasting redemption. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
studied the original tongues, in order to seize more correctly
the sense of the Scriptures, and after the pains of the struggle,
he became fixed in new and firmer convictions.</p>

<p>Farel and Lefevre conceived for each other a close friendship,
because there was at the same time between them a
similarity of principles, and a contrast of character. The old
man moderated the impetuosity of the youth, and the latter
strengthened the somewhat timid heart of his senior. The
one inclined toward mystic speculation, the other to action,
and they mutually bestowed upon one another that of which
each was deficient.</p>

<p>There was at Meaux a third person, of higher rank, who
encouraged them by his countenance and his words. This
was the bishop himself, Guillaume Briçonnet, count of Montbrun,
formerly ambassador of Francis I. to the Holy See.
Like Luther, he had brought back with him from Rome
little esteem for the papacy, and without desiring a complete
secession (as we shall see), he sought to correct its abuses.</p>

<p>When he returned to his diocese, he was disgusted with
the disorders which reigned there. Most of the curates
appropriated the revenues of their benefices, without discharging
the duties. They generally dwelt in Paris, spending
their money in licentious living, and sending in their place
wretched vicars without instruction or authority. Then, on
the occurrence of the high feasts, came the mendicant monks,
who, preaching from parish to parish, disgraced the pulpit by
low buffooneries, and troubled themselves less about edifying
the faithful than about filling their scrip.</p>

<p>Briçonnet attempted to put an end to these scandals, and
to compel the curates to reside. As their only answer, they
commenced actions against him before the metropolitan.
Then the bishop, turning towards men, who did not belong
to his clergy, called around him, not only Lefevre d’Etaples
and Farel, but also Michel d’Arande, Gérard Roussel, François
Vatable, professors or priests of exemplary conduct, who
agreed in teaching a purified religion.</p>

<p>At first their preaching began in private assemblies; then,
their courage increasing with the number of their auditors,
they ascended the public pulpits. The bishop preached in his
turn; and as if he had a presentiment that he would deny
himself in the day of persecution, “he had, in preaching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
begged the people, that if he ever changed his opinion, they
would take heed not to change theirs like him.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On hearing these discourses, which invited them to give,
not their purse to the Church, but their heart to God, the
surprise of the inhabitants of Meaux became extreme. They
were, in general, mechanics, wool-carders, fullers, cloth-workers,
and other artisans. The people flocked to the
churches from the town and surrounding country, and there
was no talk but of the new doctors.</p>

<p>Desirous of basing their teaching upon the only authority
recognised by the Reformation, Lefevre d’Etaples and
Briçonnet published the four Gospels in French. The bishop
commanded his receiver to distribute them gratuitously to
the poor, and to do so, <em>spared</em>, says Crespin, <em>neither gold nor
silver</em>. Every one began to read them. Sundays and feast-days
were devoted to this study. The Testament was even
carried into the fields and workshops, to be at hand at meal-times;
and these poor people asked each other: “How can
they help us, these saints, when they have so much to do to
help themselves? Our only mediator is Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>As they became serious in their religious views, a reformation
of manners followed. Blasphemy, drunkenness, quarrels,
disorders of all kinds, gave way to a pure and more decent
habit of living. The movement spread far and near. The
day-labourers of Picardy and other places, who came at harvest-time
to work in the neighbourhood of Meaux, returned
home with the seeds of the doctrines they had heard preached.
Hence the beginnings of several churches. This influence
was so great, that it became a proverbial way of speaking in
France, in the first half of the sixteenth century, to designate
all the opponents of Rome by the name of heretics of Meaux.</p>

<p>At the same period, Briçonnet sent the translation of the
Bible to the sister of Francis I., Marguérite de Valois, who
read and caused it to be read by those around her. Everything
thus augured a very rapid success for the French Reformation,
when the hand of persecution interfered to arrest it.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_II">II.</h3>
</div>

<p>The priests and monks of the diocese of Meaux, seeing
their credit daily weakened, and their revenues diminishing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
carried their complaints before the Sorbonne. They met
with a favourable reception. The Sorbonne, railed at by
men of letters, and attacked by the innovators, was in the
difficult position of an ancient institution outstripped by
public opinion. It felt that if it did not hasten to strike a
great blow, it would be lost.</p>

<p>At the head of this faculty of theology was one Noël
Beda, or Bedier, a doctor with no great learning, but active,
bold, sharp in disputation, capable of upsetting everything
for a theological point, and ready to look to the populace for
support, in the absence of more creditable allies. His acolytes
were the Masters Duchène and Lecouturier, who wholly
swayed their brethren by the violence of their passions and
their language.</p>

<p>Luther was invited to the Sorbonne, in 1521, for an
examination of his book upon the <cite>Captivity of Babylon</cite>. This
company declared that his doctrine was blasphemous, insolent,
impious, shameful, and that it ought to be opposed with no
other arguments than fire and sword. They compared Luther
to the great heresiarchs, and to Mahomet himself, and
demanded that he should be compelled by every possible
means to make a public retractation. The mild Melancthon
forgot his accustomed moderation in answering this sentence,
which he termed <em>the mad decree of the theologasters of Paris</em>.
“How unfortunate is France,” he said, “to have such doctors
as these!”</p>

<p>The theologians of the Sorbonne received the complainants
of Meaux with open arms, and as a bishop was implicated
in the cause, they demanded that the Parliament of Paris
should interpose with a strong hand.</p>

<p>The Parliament had no affection for the monks, and distrusted
the priests. It had maintained and defended against
them, with persevering energy, the rights of lay jurisdiction.
But it held for a fundamental maxim of the state this motto
of the olden times: <i lang="fr">Une foi, une loi, un roi</i>;—one faith, one
law, one king,—and did not believe that there ought to be
tolerated in the same country two religions, any more than
two governments.</p>

<p>The chancellor, Antoine Duprat, used all his authority to
urge the magistrature to violent measures—a man without
religion, without morals, bishop and archbishop; without
having ever put foot in his dioceses, inventor of the venality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of incumbencies, a subscriber to the Concordat which excited
the indignation of the Parliaments and even of the clergy,
elected cardinal for having humiliated the kingdom before
the Holy See—he accused himself on his death-bed of having
followed no other law than his own interest, and the interest of
his king only next to his own. Antoine Duprat had amassed
enormous riches; and when he built, at the Hôtel Dieu of
Paris, the new hall for the sick, Francis I. said, “He
must enlarge it indeed, if it is to hold all the poor he has
made.”</p>

<p>The court, which desired the support of the pope in the
Italian wars, also favoured the spirit of persecution. Louise
de Savoie, who governed the kingdom in the absence of her
son, then a prisoner at Madrid, proposed, in 1523, the following
question to the Sorbonne: <em>By what means the damnable
doctrine of Luther might be crushed and extirpated from
this very-Christian kingdom, and utterly purged therefrom</em>.
Beda and his coadjutors replied, that the heresy must be
persecuted with the extremest rigour; if not, there would
result a great injury to the honour of the king and of
Madame Louise de Savoie; and that it was the opinion of
many, it had already been borne with too long. These theologians
took care, we see, to mix up the cause of the throne
with their own.</p>

<p>Pope Clement VII. had recourse, two years after, to the
same tactics: “It behoves,” he wrote to the Parliament of
Paris, “in this great and marvellous disorder, which flows
from the rage of Satan and from the rage and wickedness of his
imps, that all the world should strive their utmost to guard
the common safety, seeing that this abomination would not
only embroil and destroy religion, but moreover all principality,
nobility, laws, orders, and degrees.”</p>

<p>The clergy held councils at Paris, under the presidency of
the cardinal Duprat, and at Bourges under that of the archbishop
François de Tournon, at which the Reformers were
accused of having plotted an <em>execrable conjuration</em>, and the
very-Christian king was exhorted to smother in his dominions
these <em>viperous dogmas</em>. The obstinate heretics were
to be exterminated, and the less guilty to undergo in prison
a perpetual penitence, with <em>the bread of grief and the water
of affliction</em>.</p>

<p>We have somewhat anticipated our recital, in order to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
who were the first authors of persecution in France. It will
be seen that Italy played the chief part therein, by means of
the regent, Louise de Savoie, with the cardinals, who are above
all Roman princes, and with the monks and the priests, who
profess to be the subjects of the Holy See, before any tie to
their own country. This observation will reappear in
different parts of this history, and we shall prove in its
place, that the massacre of St. Bartholomew was, to use the
expression of a modern writer, an <em>Italian crime</em>. Let us
return now to the church of Meaux.</p>

<p>The bishop of Briçonnet at first made head against the
storm: he had even the hardihood to call the Sorbonnists
Pharisees and hypocrites; but this firmness was of short duration;
and when he found that he would have to answer for
his acts before the Parliament, he retreated. It is unknown
to what extent he abjured the faith he had preached. Everything
was conducted with closed doors before a commission
composed of two clerical counsellors, and of two lay counsellors
of the Parliament. After having been condemned to pay a
fine of two hundred livres, Briçonnet returned to his diocese,
and tried so to live that there should be no more question
about him (1523-1525).</p>

<p>The new converts of Meaux were more resolute. One
of them, Jean Leclerc, having affixed a placard to the
cathedral door, in which he accused the pope of being Antichrist,
was condemned, in 1523, to be whipped during three
days in the crossways of the town, and branded on the
forehead. When the executioner imprinted on him the
stamp of infamy, a voice resounded from the crowd, saying,
“Long live Jesus Christ and his tokens!” The astonished
people looked around: it was the voice of his mother.</p>

<p>The following year Jean Leclerc suffered martyrdom at
Metz, which had not yet become a town of France.</p>

<p>The first of those who were burned for heresy within the
old limits of the kingdom, was a native of Boulogne, Jacques
Pauvent, or Pavannes. A disciple of Lefevre, whom he had
accompanied to Meaux, he was accused of having written
theses against purgatory, the invocation of the Virgin and
of the saints, and holy water. Crespin says: “He was a
man of great earnestness and integrity.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>He was condemned, in 1524, to be burned alive in the
Place de Grève. Pavannes, yet a young man, had, in a moment
of weakness, uttered a kind of recantation. But he
soon regained his courage, and walked to execution with a
calm front, happier to die confessing his faith, than to live
by denying it. At the stake, he discoursed on the sacrament
of the supper with so much power, that a doctor said:
“I would that Pavannes had not spoken, even had it cost
the Church a million of gold.”</p>

<p>The executions multiplied. One of the most illustrious
victims of those times was Louis de Berquin, of whom Theodore
de Bèze has said, doubtless with some exaggeration,
that he would have been another Luther for France, if he
had found in Francis I. another Elector of Saxony. The
history of his life and death throws a great light upon the
early days of the Reformation in France.</p>

<p>Louis de Berquin came of a noble family of Artois.
Unlike the knights of old, acquainted only with the helm
and the sword, he applied himself without intermission to
exercises of the mind: frank, loyal, openhearted, generous
to the poor, he arrived at the age of forty, without having
been married, or incurred the slightest suspicion of incontinence:
<em>a wonderfully rare thing among courtiers</em>, says an old
chronicle.</p>

<p>Like Lefevre and Farel, he was very devout. “Before the
Lord had given him to know His Gospel, he was,” according
to Crespin’s recital, “a great partisan of the papistical constitutions,
a constant auditor of masses and sermons, and an observer
of fasts and feast-days.... The doctrine of Luther, then
quite new in France, he held in utter abomination.” (p. 96.)</p>

<p>But two things detached him from (Roman) Catholicism. His
enlightened mind despised the gross ignorance of the doctors
of the Sorbonne; his guileless heart revolted against their
dark manœuvres; and as he had free speech at the court, he
descanted unconstrainedly before Francis I., who entertained a
great affection for him and for his character, and also on
account of his contempt for the monks.</p>

<p>A controversy which he held on scholastic subtleties with
Doctor Duchène, or Master of Quercû, as he was called, led
him to open the Bible. Berquin was altogether astonished not
to find therein what he sought, and to discover what he did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
not seek,—nothing about the invocation of the Virgin Mary;
nothing about many of the dogmas considered fundamental
in the Romish church; yet, on the other side, important
articles of which Rome scarce makes mention in her formularies.
What he thought thereupon, the knight declared
by word of mouth and by writing. The Sorbonnists, eager
to catch him at fault, denounced him before the Parliament
in 1523, and annexed to their complaints some extracts from
his books, of which they had made <em>venom, after the manner of
spiders</em>, says again our chronicle. But how, upon such complaints,
could they condemn a councillor and a favourite of
the king? He was acquitted. The doctors of the Sorbonne
pretended that this was a favour, which should excite him to
repentance; Berquin answered, it was simply justice that had
been done.</p>

<p>The quarrel increased in bitterness. The knight having
applied himself to translate some treatises of Luther and
Melancthon, Noël Beda and his underlings made a seizure of
his library. New complaint arose before the Parliament, and
citation before the bishop of Paris. Fortunately Francis
removed the matter before his council, and restored Berquin
to freedom, with an exhortation to be more prudent for the
future.</p>

<p>But to this he paid no heed; strong convictions never keep
silence. Then followed the third imprisonment of Berquin.
This time, the Sorbonnists hoped he would not escape them.
Francis I. was at Madrid. Louise de Savoie supported the
persecutors. The Parliament was resolved to proceed to
extremities. The days of Berquin were already numbered,
when a royal order, dated the 1st of April, 1526, commanded
the suspension of the matter until the king’s return.</p>

<p>When again at liberty, the lukewarm and the timid beset
him with their counsel. Erasmus, in particular, who, according
to the historians of his time, wished <em>to remain neutral
between the Gospel and Popery, and to swim between two waters</em>,
having learned that he was about to publish a translation of
one of his Latin works, with the addition of notes, wrote to
him letter upon letter, to persuade him to desist. “Leave
these hornets alone,” he said; “above all, do not mix me up
in these things. My burden is already heavy enough. If it
is your pleasure to dispute, be it so; as for me, I have no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
desire of the kind.” And elsewhere: “Ask for an embassy
to some foreign country: travel in Germany. You know
Beda and his familiars; a thousand-headed hydra is shooting
out its venom on all sides. The name of your enemies is
legion. Were your cause better than that of Jesus Christ,
they will not let you go until they have brought you to a
cruel end. Do not trust in the protection of the king.
But in any case, do not commit me with The Faculty of
Theology.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus had exhausted his common-place rhetoric to dissuade
the brave knight. “And do you know how much I
effected?” he naively asked one of his friends; “I have
redoubled his courage.” In effect, Berquin resolved to adopt
the offensive, and like the ancient king, to attack Rome in
Rome itself. He drew out from the books of Beda and his
brethren, twelve propositions, which he accused before Francis
of being false, contrary to the Bible, and heretical.</p>

<p>The outcry was tremendous. What! even the defenders
of the faith, the pillars of the Church, taxed with heresy
by a Lutheran, who had deserved death a thousand times!
and after having prosecuted others, reduced to justify themselves!</p>

<p>The king, who was not sorry to humiliate these turbulent
doctors, wrote to the Sorbonne, commanding them to censure
the twelve propositions denounced by Berquin, or to establish
them upon texts of the Bible. The matter was assuming a
grave turn, and no one knows what might have happened,
if an image of the Virgin had not been mutilated at that
time in one of the quarters of Paris.</p>

<p>The Sorbonnists immediately laid hold of the accident. “It
is a vast plot; it is,” they cried, “a great conspiracy against religion,
against the prince, against the order and tranquillity of the
country! All laws will be overthrown, all dignities abolished!
This is the fruit of the doctrines preached by Berquin!” At
the cries of the Sorbonne and of the priests, the Parliament,
the people, the king himself, are greatly excited. Death to
the image-breakers! No quarter to the heretics! And
Berquin is in prison a fourth time!</p>

<p>Twelve commissioners, delegated by the Parliament, condemn
him to make a public abjuration, then to remain incarcerated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
for the rest of his life, after having had his tongue
pierced with a hot iron. “I appeal to the king,” exclaimed
Berquin. “If you do not submit to our sentence,” replied
one of the judges, “we will find means to stop your appeals
for ever.” “I would rather die,” said Berquin, “than only
approve by my silence that the truth is thus condemned.”
“Let him then be strangled and burned upon the Place de
Grève!” said the judges with one voice.</p>

<p>The execution was delayed until Francis was absent; for it
was feared lest a last remnant of affection should be awakened
in the heart of the monarch for his loyal servant. On the
10th of November, 1539, six hundred soldiers escorted Berquin
to the place of execution. He showed no sign of depression.
“You would have said” (it is Erasmus, who recounts it
on the testimony of an eyewitness), “that he was in a library
pursuing his studies, or in a temple meditating upon things
divine. When the executioner, with husky voice, read to him
his sentence, he never changed countenance. He alighted
from the tumbril with a firm step. His was not the brutal
indifference of the hardened criminal; it was the serenity,
the peace of a good conscience.”</p>

<p>Berquin tried to speak to the people. He was not heard;
the monks had posted bands of wretches to drown his voice
with their clamour. Thus the Sorbonne of 1529 gave the
populace of Paris of 1793 the dastard example of smothering
upon the scaffold the sacred words of the dying.</p>

<p>After the execution, Doctor Merlin, the grand penitentiary,
said aloud before the people, that no one in France for perchance
a hundred years had died so good a Christian.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_III">III.</h3>
</div>


<p>In spite of the persecutions, a great number of Lutherans
had remained in the town of Meaux.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>These faithful, deserted by their preachers, and disavowed
by the bishop, assembled in secret. An isolated hut, the
garret of a woolcarder, the cover of a wood, anything sufficed,
so that they might read the Scriptures and pray together.
From time to time, one of them, torn from his humble asylum,
went to seal his faith with his blood.</p>

<p>The preachers were dispersed. Jacques Lefevre, after long
journeyings, terminated his career at Nérac, under the protection
of Marguérite de Valois. Too old to play an active
part in the French Reformation, he followed its progress
from afar. On his death-bed, he said: “I leave my body to
the earth, my soul to God, and my goods to the poor.” These
words were carved, it is said, upon his gravestone.</p>

<p>Guillaume Farel was neither of an age nor character to
be stopped by persecution. On quitting Meaux, he went to
preach the Gospel in the mountains of Dauphiny. Three of
his brothers shared his faith. Encouraged by this success,
he went preaching from town to town and place to place.</p>

<p>His appeals agitating the whole country, the priests sought
to excite it against him; but his ardour increased with the
peril. Wherever there was a place to plant his foot,—on the
border of the rivers, on the points of the rocks, in the bed of
the torrents,—he found one to announce the new doctrine.
If he was threatened, he stood firm; if surrounded, he
escaped; if thrust from one spot, he reappeared in another.
At last, when he saw himself environed on all sides,
he retreated by mountain-paths into Switzerland, and
arrived at Basle in the commencement of the year 1524.
Here, to supply the deficiency of the living word, he multiplied
the written word, and caused thousands of New Testaments
to be printed and disseminated through France by the
hands of pedlars. The Bible is a preacher which may be also
burned, no doubt, but it is a preacher which rises again from
its ashes.</p>

<p>Here and there other missionaries of the Reformation
arose. History must preserve their names: at Grenoble,
Pierre de Sebville; at Lyon, Amédée Maigret; at Mâçon,
Michel d’Arande; at Annonay, Etienne Machopolis and
Etienne Renier; at Bourges and Orleans, Melchior Wolmar,
a learned Hellenist from Germany; at Toulouse, Jean
de Caturce, a licentiate and professor of law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The last suffered martyrdom, and its circumstances are
memorable. Three capital charges had led to his seizure
in the month of January, 1532. He had proposed on the
eve of the feast of the Kings, to replace the usual dances, by
reading the Bible. Instead of saying: <em>The king drinks</em>;
he had cried: <em>Let Jesus Christ reign in our hearts</em>. At
length, he had held a religious meeting at Lemoux, his native
town.</p>

<p>Brought before the judges, he said to them: “I am ready
to justify myself upon every point. Send hither learned
men with books: we will discuss the cause article by article.”
But such a trial was dreaded. Jean de Caturce was a man
of great power of mind: he had a clear wit and ready speech,
and quoted the Scriptures with marvellous aptitude. A
pardon was offered to him, on condition that he would
retract in a public lecture. He refused, and was condemned
to death as an obstinate heretic.</p>

<p>Led soon after to the square of St. Stephen, he was degraded
from the tonsure, and next of his title of licentiate. During this
ceremony, which occupied three hours, he explained the Bible
to the assistants. A monk interrupted him to pronounce the
<em>sermon of the Catholic faith</em>, after the manner of the inquisitors.
He had taken for his text these words of the apostle Paul:
“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times
some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits
and doctrines of devils...,” and he stopped there. “Go
on, pursue the text,” said Caturce. But the other not
opening his mouth, the martyr pronounced with a loud voice
the rest of the passage: “Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry,
and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath
created to be received with thanksgiving of them, which
believe and know the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The monk was silent with
shame, and the people admired the singular readiness and
presence of mind of Caturce.</p>

<p>He was made to don the dress of a buffoon, according to
the custom introduced by the old persecutors of the Albigenses;
and brought back to his judges, who read to him
his sentence of death, when he shouted: “O palace of iniquity!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
O seat of injustice!” Two hundred and thirty years after,
Jean Calas might have pronounced the same words, as he
descended the steps of the same palace of Toulouse.</p>

<p>However, the violence of persecution did not impede the
multiplication of proselytes. They were of all ranks, and
they were already so numerous in one canton of Normandy,
that it was called <em>Little Germany</em>, as we read in a letter of
Bucer, addressed to Luther in 1530. More than one of the
religious orders threw off the gown to embrace the reformed
faith. I will cite one example, which will be, to a certain
extent, a type of a crowd of others.</p>

<p>François Lambert, born at Avignon in 1487, had conceived
from his childhood, a profound veneration for the
Franciscans, who daily passed before his door. “I admired,”
says he, “their severe costume, their sedate countenance,
their downcast eyes, their devoutly-crossed arms, their
grave demeanour; but I knew not that under these sheepskins,
foxes and wolves were hidden.”</p>

<p>The monks had also remarked the naïve exaltation of the
young man. “Come among us,” they said to him; “the
convent has an ample income: you will live in peace in your
cell, and may there pursue your studies at your ease.” He
was received as a novice when he was fifteen years and three
months old. His period of trial soon passed. The monks took
care to conceal from him their quarrels and licentiousness.
“The following year I pronounced my vows,” adds Lambert,
“not having the slightest idea of what I was doing.”</p>

<p>In effect, as soon as it was no longer feared that he would
go away, what sad discoveries! what cruel misconceptions
were there! He hoped to live among saints, and found only
abandoned and impious men. When he expressed his regret,
he was ridiculed.</p>

<p>That he might leave the convent without breaking his
vows, he got himself nominated <em>apostolic preacher</em>; but his
position was not thereby improved. He was accused of neglecting
the interests of the order. “When I returned
wearied with my rounds,” he says, “reproaches and maledictions
generally seasoned my repast.” His brethren
blamed him above everything else for censuring too severely
those who harboured them, although many of these were
vile usurers, or haunters of evil resorts. “What are you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
doing!” they would say to him; “those people will get
angry; they will give us no longer either board or lodging.”
“That is to say,” continues Lambert, “that these slaves of
their bellies are less afraid of destroying the souls of their
hosts, than of losing their dinners.”</p>

<p>In despair, he conceived the thought of becoming a Chartreux,
that he might write, if he could no longer preach.
But a new storm, and the most terrible of all, burst upon him.
The monks discovered in his cell some treatises of Luther—“Luther
in a religious house!” they vociferated with one
voice: “Heresy! heresy!” and burned these writings without
reading a line. “As for me,” says Lambert, “I believe that
Luther’s books contain more true theology than could be
found in all the books of the monks ever since monks came
into the world.”</p>

<p>He was ordered, in 1523, to carry letters to the general of
the order; but suspecting some perfidy, he profited by his
freedom to pass the frontiers of Germany, and went to seat
himself at the foot of Luther’s pulpit. “I renounce,” says
he, in concluding his recital, “all the rules of the Brethren,
persuaded that the Holy Gospel should be my only rule, and
that of all Christians. I retract everything I may have
taught contrary to the revealed faith, and I entreat those
who have heard me, to reject it as I do. I release myself
from all the ordinances of the pope, and I consent to be excommunicated
by him, knowing that he is himself excommunicated
by the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>He married in the same year (1523), and was the first of
the religious orders of France who broke the vow of celibacy.
He returned to the frontiers, at Metz and at Strasbourg,
and wished also to go to Besançon. But, having met great
obstacles everywhere, he returned to Germany, was appointed
professor at Marbourg, and helped to spread the reformed
faith in the country of Hesse. He died there in 1530, with
the reputation of a true Christian and a learned theologian.</p>

<p>While the new religion made proselytes in the towns,
in the country, and even in the convents of the provinces,
it began to penetrate into Paris. It found there a powerful
protector in Marguérite de Valois. “Her name,” says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Theodore de Bèze, “is deserving of perpetual honour, because
of her piety, and of the holy affection she has shown
for the advancement and preservation of the church of God;
so much so, that we are indebted to her for the lives of many
worthy persons.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Having heard of a reform which was shaking off the yoke
of human traditions, she wished to know it, and conversed
thereupon with Lefevre d’Etaples, Farel, and Briçonnet.
Their ideas pleased her: she read the Bible, and adopted
the new doctrines, at the same time with that tincture of mysticism,
which characterized some of those, whose lessons she
heard.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The volume of poems which she published under the title
of <cite lang="fr">Marguérite de la Marguérite des Princesses</cite>, contains
many touching revelations upon the state of her mind. She
protected the preachers of the Reformation, gave them
money for their voyages, sheltered them in secure retreats,
and obtained the liberation of many from prison. Therefore,
in their correspondence, they called her the good lady, the
very excellent, and very dear Christian.</p>

<p>Intelligent and devoted, she had rendered her brother
Francis I., during his captivity at Madrid, services not to be
forgotten, and had acquired over him an influence which she
turned to the profit of the new ideas.</p>

<p>Francis I. never well knew what he was, or what he
wished, on the subject of religion. Endowed with qualities
more brilliant than solid, he often mistook the variations of
his humour for profound calculations. Proud, beyond all
things, of being thought a knightly king, he had a passion
for arms and adventures of gallantry, which distinguished
the older chivalry, but without its stern loyalty and nice sense
of honour. The Italy of the Borgias and the Machiavels
had corrupted him, and if he had not protected the men of
letters, who have acquitted themselves before posterity most
generously of their debt to him, one might ask if he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
anything but the appearance of the virtues, which have
gained for him the appellation of a great king.</p>

<p>The Reformation pleased him as an engine for attacking
the monks, whom he contemned; but it repulsed, by its
austere maxims, a prince who had filled his court with female
favourites. The priests, beside, never ceased to represent to
him the followers of the new religion as the enemies of all
social order. The historian Seckendorf cites a letter, dated
from the French court in 1530, where they are accused of
seeking the fall of princes, perfect equality of rights, and
even the rupture of marriages and the community of goods.
Francis I. was much alarmed at these calumnies, and Brantôme
reports that he said: “These novelties have no other aim
than the destruction of all monarchy, human and divine.”</p>

<p>This enables us to understand why, in certain moments
of his reign, although he was not naturally cruel, he showed
such pitiless hostility against the Reformers. He was impressed
with the notion that he was acting as a statesman,
and he sought to smother in a sea of blood, the sinister
phantoms with which the (Roman) Catholic clergy had
peopled his imagination.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it was a strange and interesting scene to witness
the struggle between Marguérite de Valois and her brother,
upon the conduct to be pursued towards the Reformers.
At one time the Christian woman had the sway. Francis
resisted the Sorbonne. He promised to take from the Lutherans
all he could, and to the utmost. He would give
them, what has been called, <em>the mass of seven points</em>, or the
suppression of seven abuses in the worship of the Romish
church. At another time it was the Catholic or politic prince,
who seemed to triumph. Marguérite de Valois bent before
the stormy temper of her brother, shrouded herself in docility
and silence, resumed even certain practices of Catholicism,
and finally veiled her faith in such a manner that it is still a
matter of dispute whether she died in the old or the new
communion.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_IV">IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>It appeared, in 1533, as if better days were about to
dawn upon the French Reformation. The queen-mother,
Louise de Savoie, who hoped to redeem by fanatic bigotry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the libertinism of her youth, had just died. Francis I. had
made an alliance with the Protestants of the League of
Smalcald, and the credit of Marguérite de Valois had thence
increased. She took advantage of the occasion to open the
pulpits of Paris to Gérard Roussel, Courault, and Bertault,
who leaned towards the Reformed doctrines. The bishop, Jean
du Bellay, offered no opposition. He was a man of great
reading, and in his letters to Melancthon signed himself: <em>yours
cordially</em>.</p>

<p>The churches were crowded. Noël Beda, and other doctors
of the Sorbonne, tried to raise the people; but they were
banished by the Parliament. At this, the rage of the monks
grew boundless. They performed, at their college of Navarre,
a representation in which Marguérite de Valois, reading the
Bible while spinning, was suddenly changed into an infernal
fury. The Sorbonnists condemned at the same time one of
her books, entitled <cite>The Mirror of the Sinful Soul</cite>, where no
mention was made either of saints, or of purgatory, or of
any other redemption than that of Jesus Christ. A Cordelier
declared in a public sermon, that Marguérite deserved
to be inclosed in a sack and thrown into the river.</p>

<p>Such insolence was too great for the king’s endurance. He
had the regents of the college of Navarre punished, and the
censure of the Sorbonne disavowed by the university in a
body. He even threatened to inflict upon the Cordelier the
penalty with which the monk had menaced Marguérite de
Valois; but she interceded for him, and the punishment was
commuted.</p>

<p>This disposition of Francis did not last long. Having had
an interview with Clement VII. at Marseilles, in the month
of October, 1533, for the marriage of his son Henry with
Catherine de Medici, the pope’s niece, and being desirous of
an alliance with this pontiff for the conquest of the Milanese,
the dream of his life, he returned to Paris with a mind
bent against the heretics. Many Lutherans, or Sacramentarians,
as they were then called, were cast into prison, and
the three suspected preachers interdicted from preaching.</p>

<p>All the new converts, already very numerous, did not
bear the stroke of persecution patiently, and were sorely
grieved to be deprived of their pastors. At this juncture
one Féret arrived, bringing from Switzerland placards against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the mass, which he proposed to disseminate throughout the
kingdom. The most prudent opposed the design, affirming
that too much precipitation would ruin everything. But
the enthusiasts, as always happens in moments of crisis,
prevailed.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October, 1534, the inhabitants of Paris
found on the public places, in the crossways, on the palace-walls,
on the doors of the churches, a placard with this title:
“Truthful articles concerning the horrible, great, and unbearable
abuses of the Popish Mass, invented directly against
the Holy Supper of our Lord, the only Mediator, and only
Saviour, Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>This document was written in a bitter and violent style.
Popes, cardinals, bishops, and monks were attacked with the
sharpest invectives. It thus concluded: “In fine, truth has
deserted them, truth threatens them, truth chases them,
truth fills them with fear; by all which shall their reign be
shortly destroyed for ever.”</p>

<p>The people gathered in groups around the placards. Horrible
rumours circulated, such as the masses invent in their
days of rage. The Lutherans, it was said, had laid a frightful
plot for burning the churches, firing the town, and massacring
every one. And the multitude shouted: <em>Death! death to the
heretics!</em> The priests and monks, who were perhaps the first
deceived, kindled the rage. The magistrates, although more
calm, were irritated by so daring an attack upon the ecclesiastical
order of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The tempest burst with equal violence at the Château de
Blois, where Francis I. was at the time. A placard had been
posted (many suspected, by the hand of an enemy) on the
very door of the king’s apartment. The prince saw therein
an insult, not only against his authority, but against his
person, and the Cardinal de Tournon imbedded this notion
so deep in his heart, that he deliberated, says an historian,
upon destroying all, had it been in his power.</p>

<p>Orders were immediately issued to seize the Sacramentarians,
dead or alive. The criminal-lieutenant, Jean-Morin, obtained
the assistance of a certain sheath or scabbard-maker, who had
been a summoner for the secret meetings, and whose life had
been promised him on condition that he should lead the serjeants
to the houses of the heretics. Some, warned in time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
took flight; the others, men and women, those who had condemned
the placards, as well as those who had approved them,
were thrust alike pell-mell into the prisons.</p>

<p>It is reported that the civil-lieutenant, having entered the
house of one of them, Barthélemy Milon, a cripple, wholly
helpless of body, said to him: “Come, get thee up.” “Alas,
sir,” replied the paralytic, “it must be a greater master than
you to raise me up.” The serjeants carried him off, and the
courage of his companions in captivity grew firm through his
exhortations.</p>

<p>Their trial was soon over. But for the Sorbonne and the
clergy, the blood of the heretics was not enough. Their
object was to strike the imagination of the people by a
<i lang="it">generalissimo</i> procession, and, by persuading the king to be
present, to bind him decisively to the system of persecution.
This <i lang="fr">fête</i> marks an important date in our recital; for it was
from this moment that the Parisian populace took part in
the contest against the heretics; and, once mounted on the
stage, they never quitted it until the end of the League.
In the chain of events, this procession, intermingled with
executions, was the first of the bloody days of the sixteenth
century; the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the Barricades,
the murder of Henry III., and the assassination of Henry IV.,
could but follow.</p>

<p>A chronicler of the time, Simon Fontaine, a doctor of the
Sorbonne, has left us a long description of this event. It took
place on the 29th of January, 1535. An innumerable concourse
had come from all the surrounding country. “There was not the
smallest piece of wood or stone jutting from the walls which
was not occupied, provided there was room on it for anybody.
The house-tops were covered with men, great and small, and
one might have supposed the streets to have been paved with
heads.”</p>

<p>Never had so many relics been paraded through the streets
of Paris. The reliquary of the Sainte-Chapelle was then
first brought out. Priests bore the head of St. Louis, a piece
of the holy cross, the true crown of thorns, a real nail, and
also the spear-head which had pierced the side of our
Lord. The shrine of St. Geneviéve, the patron saint of
Paris, was carried by the corporation or company of butchers,
who had fitted themselves for the holy office by a fast of
several days, and each one was bent upon touching the precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
relic with the tip of his finger, or with his handkerchief,
or cap.</p>

<p>Cardinals, archbishops, and bishops, coped and mitred,
figured in their places. Then came the king, bareheaded,
holding a burning torch of wax in his hand; after him
walked all the princes, knights, counsellors of the Parliaments,
companies of the trades, and fraternities. In front of their
houses stood the burgesses with lighted tapers, who sank on
their knees as the holy sacrament went by.</p>

<p>After mass, the king dined at the palace of the bishop,
with his sons, the queen, and the princes of the blood royal.
At the conclusion of the repast, he called together the clergy,
ambassadors, lords, presidents of the courts of justice, all
the notables; and having seated himself on a throne, he
protested that he would not pardon, even in his children,
the crime of heresy; and that if he knew that one of the
members of his body were infected with it, he would cut it
off with his own hands.</p>

<p>The same day, six Lutherans were burned. The most
courageous had had their tongues cut out beforehand, lest a
word of faith or a prayer, issuing from the flames, might
move the conscience of the executioners. They were suspended
on a moveable gibbet, which, rising and falling by
turns, plunged them into the fire or drew them out, until
they were entirely consumed. This was the punishment of
the <i lang="fr">estrapade</i>. The ferocious emperor of Rome, who wished
that his victims might feel themselves die, had not invented
that cruelty, and the Inquisition of Spain accorded to the Saracens
and the Jews the favour of being more quickly burned.</p>

<p>On his return to the Louvre, Francis saw these executions.
The hangmen waited for his passing, that he might witness
the show.</p>

<p>An ordinance was soon published, decreeing the extermination
of heretics, with pain of death against those who should
conceal them, and a reward of a fourth of the goods of the
victims to informers.</p>

<p>Francis I. had soon occasion to repent of having yielded
to this excess of frenzy. The Protestants of Germany were
indignant, and threatened to ally themselves against him,
with the House of Austria. He sent them explanations
through his ambassador, Guillaume de Langey, to say that
those whom he had put to death were rebels, Sacramentarians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and not Lutherans. He even resumed, in order to effect
a reconciliation with the League of Smalcald, the overtures
which had been made to Melancthon, to attract him to Paris;
and he published a milder edict, directing the release of
persons suspected of heresy, on condition that they should
abjure within six months. This edict of Coucy, drawn for
diplomatic reasons, was never carried into execution.</p>

<p>Marguérite de Valois retired to Béarn, where her little
court became the asylum of the celebrated men who escaped
from persecution. Many refugee families brought thither
their industry and their fortunes. Everything assumed a new
face. The laws were corrected, the arts cultivated, agriculture
was improved, schools were established, and the people
were prepared to receive the teaching of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The queen of Navarre died in 1549, wept for by the Béarnese,
who loved to repeat her generous saying: “Kings and
princes are not the lords and masters of their inferiors, but only
ministers whom God has set up to serve and to keep them.”</p>

<p>Marguérite de Valois was the mother of Jeanne d’Albret,
and grandmother of Henry IV.</p>

<p>The prey of calumnies that descended from the throne,
and from thence spread throughout all Europe; accused of
sedition, blasphemy, enmity to God and to man; judged and
condemned with closed doors; their tongues mutilated before
undergoing their final sentence, the Reformers of France had
no means of justification, and their very martyrdom was dishonoured.</p>

<p>It was then that the most energetic of apologies appeared
in the <cite>Institutes of the Christian Religion</cite>. “This,” says
Calvin, in the preface to his commentary on the Psalms, “is
what led me to publish the <cite>Institutes</cite>: first, to relieve my
brethren from an unjust accusation, whose death was precious
before the Lord; and moreover, that, as the same sufferings
were suspended over the heads of many poor faithful, foreign
nations might be touched with commiseration for their woes,
and might afford them a shelter.”</p>

<p>This book announced the true leader of the French
Reformation. Luther was too distant, and his German genius
could not wholly sympathize with that of France. Guillaume
Farel was too ardent; he had not that firm and solid character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
which was necessary for great undertakings. The
others were obscure. The growing churches awaited a man
able to place himself at their head, and Calvin was this man.</p>

<p>His life is everywhere; I will only recount that which
enters into the plan of this history.</p>

<p>Jean Calvin was born in 1509 at Noyon, in Picardy.
Destined from his infancy to the priesthood, he was presented
with an ecclesiastical benefice at the age of twelve.
But his own will and that of his father led him from theology
to the law, which he went to study at Bourges and at
Orleans. He distinguished himself there by his precocious
intelligence and the severity of his manners.</p>

<p>The Reformation agitated at that time all the schools of
learning. Masters and students occupied themselves with
nothing else, either through a spirit of curiosity, or through
the yearning of conscience and faith. Calvin was among
these last, and the Bible which he received from the hands
of one of his relations, Pierre Robert Olivétan, detached
him from Catholicism, as it had already rescued Zwinglius and
Luther. The three great Reformers arrived at the same end
by the same road.</p>

<p>He was not of those who are silent on what they believe.
Listeners flocked round him, and the solitude he loved
became impossible for him. “As for me,” he says again, in
the preface to his commentary on the Psalms, “inasmuch as
being naturally diffident and retiring I have always preferred
repose and tranquillity; I began to seek for some hiding-place,
and means of withdrawing myself from the world; but
so far from obtaining my wish, every retreat and every
secluded spot were to me so many public schools.”</p>

<p>Calvin comprehended that his time and his powers were
no longer his own. He preached in the secret meetings at
Bourges and at Paris. Theodore de Bèze says: “He advanced
wonderfully the cause of God in many families, teaching the
truth not with an affected language, to which he was always
opposed, but with a depth of knowledge and so much
gravity of speech, that no man heard him without being
filled with admiration.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He was at that time twenty-four
years of age.</p>

<p>A discourse which he composed, in 1533, for the rector of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the university of Paris, and which was condemned for heresy
by the Sorbonne, compelled him to fly. It is said that he
escaped by a window, a few moments before the serjeants
broke into his chamber.</p>

<p>He withdrew, under the name of Charles d’Espeville, to
Angoulême, and was received into the house of the canon
Louis du Tillet, where he had a rich library at his service.</p>

<p>He was already occupied with his great work on the
Christian religion, and laboured upon it with such ardour
that he frequently passed nights without sleeping, and days
without eating. When he had finished a chapter, he read it
to his friends; and on opening the manuscript, he was wont
to say: “Let us find the truth.”</p>

<p>He sowed the doctrines of the Reformation in Poitou
and Saintonge, publicly when he could, secretly when persecution
was too violent. There is still shown near Poitiers
an excavation to which popular tradition gives the name of
<em>Calvin’s cave</em>. When there one day with several of his disciples,
one of them represented that there must be truth in
the sacrifice of the Mass, since it was celebrated in every
place in Christendom. “My mass is there,” replied Calvin,
pointing to the Bible. Then throwing down upon the table
his cap, and raising his eyes to heaven, he exclaimed: “O
Lord, if on the day of judgment Thou reprehendest me for
that I have been to Mass and that I have deserted it, I will
say to Thee with reason: Lord, Thou hast not bidden me to
it. There is Thy law; there is the Scripture Thou hast
given me, in the which I have found no other sacrifice than
Thy immolation on the altar of the cross.”</p>

<p>The supper was celebrated in the depth of the cavern by
Calvin and his friends. So, fourteen centuries before, the
Christians communicated in the catacombs of Rome; so, two
centuries after, the Reformers of France have held communion
in the wilderness; and still later, in the days of the Revolution,
(Roman) Catholic priests have erected their altars amidst
the woods.</p>

<p>Constantly in peril of his life, Calvin went to fix himself
at Bâle, the city of refuge for the French, when the Geneva
of the Reformation did not yet exist. There the last touch
was put to his <cite>Institutes of the Christian Religion</cite>, and it
appeared in the month of August, 1535.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>This was the first theological and literary monument of
the French Reformation. There may be disputes about
Calvin’s notions (he belonged to his time, as we do to ours),
but his genius cannot be contested. His premises, which
corresponded to the intellectual and moral level of his
times, once laid down, he pursued them with an incomparable
vigour of logic. His system was completed.</p>

<p>Spreading abroad in the schools, the castles of the gentry,
the houses of the burghers, even the workshops of the people,
the <cite>Institutes</cite> became the most powerful of preachers.
Round this book the Reformers arrayed themselves as round
a standard. They found in it everything—doctrine, discipline,
ecclesiastical organization; and the apologist of the
martyrs became the legislator of their children.</p>

<p>We will not dwell upon the lofty style of the <cite>Institutes</cite>;
Calvin cared little for literary fame, whatever Bossuet may
have said. He went straight to the point, and the expression
came clear, energetic, full of life, from the very circumstance
of his only troubling himself about the correctness of
his thoughts.</p>

<p>In his dedicatory epistle to Francis I., he refuted the
following objections addressed to the disciples of the Reformation:
“Your doctrine is new and untried; you confirm it by
no miracle; you are in contradiction with the Fathers; you
overthrow tradition and custom; you make war upon the
Church; you engender sedition.” In concluding, Calvin supplicated
the king to examine the confession of faith of the
Reformers, so that, beholding them to be in accordance with
the Bible, he might treat them no longer as heretics. “It is
your duty, sire,” he says to the king, “to close neither your
understanding nor your heart against so just a defence, especially
when the question is of such high import, namely, how
the glory of God shall be maintained on earth.... A matter
worthy of your ears, worthy of your jurisdiction, worthy of
your royal throne!”</p>

<p>We are assured that the king did not deign even to read
this epistle. Some court intrigue, or a caprice of the Duchess
d’Etampes, absorbed, it would appear, his leisure. If one
considered, not the hand of God, that orders all things, but
the visible causes of events, upon what would depend the
religious and political destiny of nations?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>His <cite>Institutes</cite> were scarcely finished before Calvin went to
Italy to see Rénée de France, daughter of Louis XII. and
duchess of Ferrara, who had, like Marguérite de Valois,
opened her heart to the Reformed faith. This visit established
a correspondence which was never interrupted, and Calvin
still wrote to her when on his death-bed.</p>

<p>In 1536 he was appointed pastor and professor at Geneva.
The religious, moral, intellectual, and even political revolution
he brought into that town with him, is beside our work. Let
us only add, that from his new country he never ceased to
act upon France by his books, his letters, and by the numerous
students, who, after having received his lessons, carried back
to their churches what he had taught them. Calvin was the
guide of the French Reformers, their counsellor, the soul of
their first synods; and the immense authority he exercised
over them was so well recognised, that the name of <em>Calvinists</em>
was given to them about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>“He was most restless for the advance of his sect,” says
Etienne Pasquier. “When our prisons were gorged with
victims, he incessantly exhorted, consoled, confirmed them by
his letters, and never wanted messengers, to whom the doors
were open, despite whatever trouble the gaolers might take.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Considering the irreparable loss the Romish church has
suffered through this Reformer, we are little astonished at the
anathemas she poured upon him, and with which she still pursues
him. She has measured the strength of her blows according
to the magnitude of her wounds. We are not penning
Calvin’s apology, but some short explanations may not be out
of place here. Calvin has been accused of ambition. He had
only that which is common to men of genius, who are thrust
into the foremost rank by the instinct of ordinary minds, and
by the force of circumstances. Did they refuse to ascend, they
would not be humble; they would be unfaithful to their
mission, and prevaricators. The vulgar herd, which sees
their lofty position, raises the cry of pride: it judges the
vocation of great souls by its own.</p>

<p>It is also said that Calvin was absolute and inflexible in
his ideas. Yes, because he had strong convictions, with the
consciousness of his own superiority. And if we consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
the wants of his time, it will be acknowledged, perhaps, that
this was the only way of preventing the new doctrines from
failure in every sense, and being lost.</p>

<p>That he should appear to us, at the distance we are from him,
with our opinions and our manners, to have fallen into grave
errors, may be conceived. But to judge him properly, it is
from his own point of view, and from that of his age, that we
must observe him—not from our own.</p>

<p>We are constantly reminded of the execution of Michel
Servet. If it be said that this was an act to be deeply
deplored, the remark is just; but if Calvin is accused of
contradicting his own maxims, it will only be proved that
those who make the accusation have never studied them.
The Protestants claimed the right of citizenship in Germany,
in Switzerland, in France, in the name, in the sole name of
the Divine truth of which they judged themselves to be the
faithful interpreters, and never in the name of liberty of
belief and of worship. To convince oneself of this, it is only
necessary to read the detail of their trials. Not a single
word could be found in the whole volume of <cite>Crespin’s Martyrs</cite>,
expressive of toleration understood in the sense of
Bayle, Locke, and modern ideas. They justify themselves
by texts from the Bible, and summon their adversaries to
prove that their faith is not conformable to it, or able to
absolve them. Their defence is here, and here only. If it had
been proposed to them to accord similar rights to those whom
they themselves regarded as impious or heretics, they would
have beheld herein a rebellion against the will of God. It
is not, therefore, Calvin who set up the stake of Michel
Servet: it is the whole sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>If Rome beholds in this act an excuse for her own intolerance,
we do not deny it. But it is no excuse for her refinements
of cruelty; it is none for her slaughters <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, nor
for her perpetual violations of plighted faith. Either no treaty
of peace, no contract between the two worships ought to have
been accepted, or, when they were accepted, they ought to
have been kept.</p>

<p>We will further observe, that if the two communions were
intolerant in the sixteenth century, the one was so by virtue
of its principles, the other was so in spite of itself. The Reformation,
by granting the right of private judgment, had
indirectly established religious liberty. It did not perceive
at once all the consequences of this principle, because the
Reformers had carried over with them a part of the prejudices
of their first education; but these consequences were to
become apparent sooner or later, and it is therefore justly
regarded as the mother of all modern liberty.</p>

<p>Calvin had a share in only one execution. His heart was
not cruel, and he was horrified at all the sanguinary acts
unauthorized by a regular judicial sentence. He more than
once restrained the hands of those who would have shed the
blood of François de Guise, the cut-throat of Vassy. “I
can protest,” he wrote to the duchess of Ferrara, “that it
alone depended upon me that men of resolve and action,
before the war, who were only restrained by my exhortation,
did not devote themselves to exterminate him from the
world.”</p>

<p>Calvin was sometimes impatient and irascible, and he has
accused himself of being so. But the soft and affectionate sentiments
that one would scarcely expect to find in the austere
soul of the Reformer, were not strangers to him. Read his
correspondence with his intimate friends Farel and Viret:
how one hears the voice of the man, who reposed in the
bosom of friendship from the grievous duties of his charge!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and with what emotion the minister Des Gallards, who had
spent sixteen years near him, speaks of his goodness!</p>

<p>He died poor. His disinterestedness was so great that
the sceptic Bayle, on relating that he had left only three
hundred crowns, inclusive of his library, could not repress a
cry of admiration. “It is one of the rarest victories,” says
he, “that virtue and grandeur of soul can obtain over nature
in those who exercise the apostolic mission.”</p>

<p>The prodigious labours of Calvin oppress our imagination.
“I do not believe,” Theodore de Bèze states, “that his equal
can be found. Beside preaching every day from week to
week, most frequently and whenever he could, he preached
twice every Sunday. He lectured three times a week on
theology. He made the remonstrances at the consistory,
and gave an entire lecture every Friday in the conference of
the Scripture, which we call Congregation; and he so persisted
in this course to his death, that he never missed once,
except when extremely ill. For the rest, who can recount
his other works, ordinary and extraordinary? I do not think
any man of our time has had more to hear, to answer, to
write, or things of greater importance to deal with. The
multiplicity and quality of his writings are alone sufficient to
astound every man who looks at them, and still more those
who read them. And what makes his labours more astonishing
is, that his frame was naturally so weak, so attenuated by
watching and too great abstinence, and what is more, subject
to so many disorders, that any man who saw him could not
have thought but that he had a very short while to live;
and yet, notwithstanding all this, he never ceased to labour
night and day in the Lord’s work. Many a time we urged
him to take more care of himself; but his constant answer
was that he did next to nothing, and that we ought to let
him be, so that God might find him watching and working
his best, until his last breath.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Calvin died on the 27th of May, 1564, aged fifty-five
years all but one month. He was of the middle height, and
had a pale face, brown complexion, and serene, brilliant eyes.
He was neat and plain in his dress; and he ate so little, that
for many years he took but one meal a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>A few weeks before his death he dictated his will, in
which he takes God to witness as to the sincerity of his faith,
and offers his thanksgivings that he should have been employed
in the service of Jesus Christ and the truth.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_VI">VI.</h3>
</div>


<p>The persecutions we have seen until now, appear
moderate beside those of which the Vaudois of Provence
were the victims. To find a parallel for so fearful a butchery,
we must go back to the extermination of the Albigeois.</p>

<p>On the 18th of November, 1540, the parliament of Aix
passed a decree to the following effect: Seventeen inhabitants
of Mérindol shall be burned alive. Their wives, children,
parents, and servants, shall be arrested and brought to trial,
and if they cannot be taken, they shall be banished the kingdom
for ever. The houses of Mérindol shall be burned and
razed to the ground, the woods cut down, the fruit-trees uprooted,
and the place rendered uninhabitable, and no one
shall be allowed to build there. “As exorbitant, cruel, and
inhuman a decree,” says a contemporary, “as any parliament
ever made, and like in every respect to the edict of the king
Ahasuerus against the people of God.”</p>

<p>A cry of horror arose throughout Provence. It is sad to
relate that the priests were the most unrelenting in urging
the execution of the sentence. And when the chief president
Chassanée represented to them that the king might be
displeased at so great a destruction of his subjects, a bishop
said to him: “If the king should think ill of it at first, we
will soon cause him to approve it: we have the cardinals
with us, and particularly Cardinal Tournon, to whom nothing
could be more pleasing.”</p>

<p>The Vaudois presented a petition to Francis I., who being
then desirous of keeping on good terms with the Protestant
princes of the empire, commissioned Guillaume de Langey,
the same who had been his ambassador to Germany, to cause
an inquiry to be made respecting this devastation.</p>

<p>These Vaudois formed a population of about eighteen
thousand souls. They had come from Piedmont and Dauphiny
into Provence, and had dwelt there for three hundred
years. When they first settled in the country, it was uncultivated,
and overrun with brigands; but, under the tillage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
their hands, it was covered with plentiful harvests. A domain
which before their establishment would not have let for
four crowns, fetched from three to four hundred. They had
built Mérindol, Cabrières, and twenty other towns or villages.</p>

<p>They were a peaceable, well-ordered people, loved by their
neighbours, faithful to their promise, just in the payment
of their debts, careful of their poor, and charitable to
strangers. Never could they be drawn into any kind of
swearing or blasphemy: they never used an oath, but
when required to do so in the administration of the law. They
were also distinguished for this, that if they chanced to be in
any company where improper conversation was heard, they
immediately withdrew, in order to signify their displeasure.</p>

<p>There was nothing to reproach them with, unless it was
that when they frequented the towns and the markets, they
seldom visited the conventual churches, and if they did, they
offered their prayers without reference to the saints. They
passed by the crosses and images on the roadside without
showing any reverence. They said no Mass, nor <i lang="la">Libera
me</i>, nor <i lang="la">De profundis</i>; they took no holy water, and if it
were offered them in any house, they set no store by it. They
undertook no pilgrimage for the sake of pardons. When it
thundered, they never made the sign of the cross, and they
presented no offerings either for the living or the dead.</p>

<p>For a long time unknown, the Vaudois excited neither the
cupidity of the priests nor the hatred of the great, and the
gentry, whose incomes they augmented, gave them their
protection. They chose among themselves their pastors, or
<i lang="fr">Barbes</i>, as they termed them, to instruct them in the knowledge
and the practice of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>As he was passing through Dauphiny in 1501, these
heretics were denounced to King Louis XII., who caused an
inquiry to be instituted; but after having read it, he ordered
that the processes already begun should be thrown into the
Rhone, saying: “These people are much better Christians
than myself.”</p>

<p>When they heard, about the year 1530, of the preaching
of Luther and Zwinglius, they sent some of their pastors to
Switzerland and Germany, who recognised in the Reformation
a sister of their own communion. Encouraged by these new
friends, they caused the first edition of the Bible, translated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
into French by Robert Olivétan, to be printed at Neufchâtel,
in 1535. It is said that they expended upon it many hundred
gold crowns.</p>

<p>The ire of the Romish clergy was excited against this
heresy, and the more so as many of the gentry, advocates,
counsellors of justice, and even theologians, showed a leaning
towards it. A decree was pronounced, in 1535, against the
Vaudois. A second decree—that which we have cited—was
delivered in 1540. Francis I., adopting the advice of Guillaume
de Langey, granted them letters of pardon, but upon
condition that they should return to the church of Rome
before the expiration of three months. This was to withdraw
with one hand, what he had given with the other.</p>

<p>This courageous people, however, did not lose courage. They
sent to the parliament of Aix, and to Francis, their confession
of faith, in which they took care to establish all their doctrines,
article by article, on texts from the Scriptures. When
this confession was read to him by his order, the king, <em>quite
amazed</em>, says Crespin, asked where fault could be found; and
no one had the hardihood to offer a contradiction.</p>

<p>The bishops of Provence, finding themselves unsupported
in their system of persecution, commissioned three doctors
of theology to convert the Vaudois; but, marvel of marvels!
all three were themselves converted to the proscribed religion:
“I am compelled to confess,” said one of these doctors, after
his interrogatories to some catechumens, “that I have often
been to the Sorbonne to hearken to the disputations of the
theologians, and that I have not learned there so much as I
have done from listening to these little children.”</p>

<p>The rage of the priests was now at its height; and the
chief president Chassanée being dead, they persuaded his
successor, Jean Meynier, baron d’Oppède, to prosecute the
heretics without mercy. Memorials were sent at the same
time to the king, in which the Vaudois were accused of an
intention to seize upon Marseilles, to form a sort of republican
canton, in imitation of the Swiss. Francis did not become
a dupe to this ridiculous fable; he knew very well that
a few thousand poor peasants could not convert Provence
into a republic. But he had just concluded a treaty with
Charles V., through the mediation of Paul III., by which the
two monarchs engaged themselves to exterminate heresy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
This prince lay, moreover, dangerously ill, and the Cardinal de
Tournon, seconded by several bishops, beseeched him, in the
name of his eternal salvation, to revoke his letters of pardon.
He thereupon wrote to the Parliament of Aix, on the 1st
of January, 1545, to execute the decree pronounced against
the Vaudois.</p>

<p>The Baron d’Oppède, who appears to have imported into
this horrible enterprise motives of jealousy and personal
vengeance, collected bands of mercenaries, who had been
accustomed in the Italian wars to the most frightful brigandage.
He placed over them some officers of Provence,
and took the field on the 2nd of April. Then began a horrible
carnage. “They were no longer,” says an historian, “either
gentlemen or soldiers: they were butchers.”</p>

<p>The Vaudois were surprised and massacred, like the deer in
a hunt; their houses were burned, their cornfields laid waste,
trees uprooted, wells choked, bridges destroyed. All were put
to the fire and the sword; and the peasants of the surrounding
country, joining the executioners, completed the pillage of
the miserable remnants of the devastation.</p>

<p>Those of the Vaudois who could fly, wandered about the
woods and mountains; but the weaker, the old men and children
and women, were forced to stay, and were slain by the soldiery,
after having satiated their brutal passions. At Mérindol
there only remained one poor idiot, who had promised two
crowns to a soldier for his ransom. D’Oppède purchased
from his purse the fate of the unhappy wretch, and causing
him to be tied to a tree, had him shot. Scarce a gentleman
present could restrain his tears.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, in obedience to the summons of the
vice-legate, this army of executioners entered the county of
Venasque, belonging to the pope, and fresh bodies of banditti
hastened thither under the guidance of priests. The town of
Cabrières was besieged. Sixty men, who alone had remained
there, held out for twenty-four hours. On the promise of
their lives, they came forth unarmed, and were immediately
hacked to pieces. Their women, shut up in a barn, were burned
alive. A soldier, moved to pity, tried to open them a passage,
but they were driven back into the flames with the halbert.
The church of Cabrières was profaned with infamous debauches;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
and the steps of the altar were inundated with blood. The
clergy of Avignon blessed the murderers: they had pronounced
a sentence decreeing no quarter. The day was to
come when the <i lang="fr">glacière</i> of Avignon should count other
victims. There is justice upon earth for the privileged classes,
who abuse their power: it is sometimes tardy, but it is sure.</p>

<p>The Vaudois perished in numbers in their wild retreats.
The vice-legate and the Parliament of Aix had forbidden,
under pain of death, that any shelter or food should be given
them, “which,” says Bouche, the historian of Provence,
“was the means of killing a very great many.” Numbers of
the unhappy people supplicated D’Oppède to accord them permission
to depart, even with nothing but their shirts. “I
know what I have to do with this people of Mérindol and
their like,” answered he: “I will send them to dwell in hell,
them and their children.”</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty prisoners were put to death, after
a mock trial; a more atrocious act than the massacre, since
it was committed in cold blood. Others, the youngest and
more robust, were sent to the galleys. A few succeeded in
gaining the frontiers of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The name of the Vaudois disappeared almost entirely from
Provence, and their country relapsed into as desolate a wilderness
as it was three centuries before.</p>

<p>History has preserved the pious words uttered by the
Vaudois, who had taken refuge with their pastors in the
mountain gorges. Prepared for death, and beholding in the
distance the blazing ruins of their dwellings, the old and
young thus exhorted each other: “The least of our cares
should be for our property and our lives; the greatest and
chiefest fear that ought to fill us with emotion, is lest we
fail in the confession of our Lord Jesus Christ and his holy
Gospel. Let us call on God, and he will have pity upon us.”</p>

<p>The massacre of the Vaudois raised the indignation of all
France; the souls of the people were not yet merciless, as
they became during the religious wars. The king complained
that his orders had been exceeded; but, sick and almost dying,
he gave way to the representations of the Cardinal de Tournon,
and had not the courage to punish the assassins. But,
in his last moments, he adjured his son to take vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
upon them, adding that if he failed therein, his memory
would be execrated throughout the world.</p>

<p>In effect, the matter was brought before the Parliament of
Paris in 1550, where it occupied fifty audiences. The advocate
of the Vaudois, or rather of the Lady du Cental, who
complained that she had been ruined, spoke for seven days
consecutively, with a force which was said to have shown the
things, instead of relating them. The Baron d’Oppède defended
himself, and had the audacity to commence his pleading
with these words of the Psalmist: “Judge me, O God,
and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.” He was
acquitted. The advocate-general Guérin only was condemned
to death, and care was taken to specify in the sentence
that he had been guilty of misappropriating the king’s
money; as if a whole people murdered was not a sufficient
crime in the eyes of these judges.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_VII">VII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Towards the end of the reign of Francis I., and under
that of his son Henry II., the Reformation made such
rapid progress, that it becomes impossible to follow it in all
its details. Men of letters, of the law, of the sword, of the
Church itself, hastened to its banner. Several great provinces,—Languedoc,
Dauphiny, the Lyonnese, Guienne, Saintonge,
Poitou, the Orleanese, Normandy, Picardy, Flanders;
the most considerable towns of the kingdom,—Bourges,
Orleans, Rouen, Lyons, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Montpellier, La
Rochelle, were peopled with Reformers. It is calculated that
they comprised in a few years nearly a sixth of the population,
of whom they were the <i lang="fr">élite</i>. They might have repeated the
saying of Tertullian: “We date only from yesterday, and
are, yet, everywhere.”</p>

<p>If the persecution kept some aloof, it brought the accession
of a greater number, through that instinct, which impels the
human conscience to rise against injustice, and incline to the
side of the victim. Moreover, the faith, the constancy, and
the serenity of the martyrs soared above the ferocity of the
executioner.</p>

<p>The impulse once given to the movement, everything was
shaken. There was in the understanding, in the heart, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
so to say, in the air one breathed, an immense want of religious
reforms. People began to reflect that religion is not
to be transmitted, like a name or an estate which one inherits,
but that, before accepting it, one is bound to examine it by and
for oneself. People also began to consider more minutely
the enormous abuses of the Romish church, and crowds
separated themselves from that degenerated communion.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical benefices were distributed, particularly
after the Concordat, which had abolished the electoral forms,
among court favourites, soldiers, intriguers, and even children;
all incapable of fulfilling the duties of their offices. There
were supernumerary prelates, who were derisively called
flying, or portative bishops. The cardinals set the example of
disorder. The prelates lived a scandalous life at Paris. The
members of the lower clergy were, in general, immoral and
greedy, the monks ignorant and shameless. This conduct
was compared with that of the preachers of the Reformation,
men of simple habits, for the most part poor and grave; and
the contrast was so striking, that honest hearts could not
resist it. Without some great lords on one side, and the
lowest of the people on the other, the church of Rome was
lost in France.</p>

<p>The provincial nobility, which had not been depraved in
the atmosphere of the royal household, were all inclined to
the new ideas. They entertained against the privileges of
the priests, and against their territorial encroachments, an
old, though suppressed hostility, that only waited an occasion
to burst forth. They had, beside, considerable leisure in their
castles, since the severe interdiction of wars of lord against
lord; and reading at eve, around the feudal hearth, the Holy
Scriptures, they were drawn, almost without being aware of
it, to the teachings of Luther and Calvin.</p>

<p>The people of the third estate, who had received a lettered
education,—advocates, legists, professors, notable burghers,—were
already won beforehand, by their very studies, to these
opinions. “Above all,” says with great simplicity an historian
devoted to Catholicism, “painters, watchmakers, sculptors,
goldsmiths, booksellers, printers, and others, who, from their
callings, have some nobility of mind, were among the first
easily surprised.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>Traders, who voyaged in foreign countries, brought back
impressions favourable to the Reformation. They recognised
that this religion, by correcting the manners of the people,
developed at the same moment their commerce, and contributed
to the advance of their industry.</p>

<p>Many secular and regular ecclesiastics in the provinces
were also shaken. Having taken orders without having
learned any other thing than the barbarous theology of the
schools, they had taught their dogmas in good faith. But
placed face to face with the new dogma, they saw the stamp
of truth upon it. They then betook themselves to some
business for a livelihood, and, working at their handicraft,
preached in secret the doctrines of the Reformation. They
were encouraged by the thought that Rome would sooner
or later come to an understanding with the Reformers in a
general council. Hence those contradictions among some of
them, which have not been sufficiently comprehended by our
older historians.</p>

<p>The hawkers of Bibles and religious tracts aided powerfully
in these conquests of the new faith. They were called bale-bearers,
basket or library-carriers. They belonged to different
classes of society: many were students in theology, or even
ministers of the Gospel.</p>

<p>The printing-presses of Geneva, Lausanne, Neufchâtel,
specially established to inundate France with religious
writings, furnished them with books. And then, staff in
hand, basket on back, through heat and cold, by lonely ways,
through mountain-ravines and dreary morasses, they went
from door to door, often ill received, always at the hazard of
their lives, and knowing not in the morning where to lay
their head at night. It was chiefly through them that the
Bible penetrated into the manor of the noble, and beneath
the hut of the villager.</p>

<p>Exposed, like the old Vaudois of Piedmont, to cruel pursuit,
the new pedlars imitated their ingenuity, by placing at
the top of their packs pieces of stuff or other unsuspicious
objects, while they concealed beneath, the prohibited wares.
“To gain easier access in the towns, in the country, in the
houses of the nobility,” says again Florimond de Rémond,
“some of them went as hawkers of little trinkets for the ladies,
hiding in the depth of their bales the little books, which they
presented to girls; but this was done furtively, as if they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
things of great rarity, to make them better relished.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
From the many victims they furnished to the scaffold and
the stake, we must suppose these humble packmen to have
been very numerous. We cannot dwell upon this subject;
but history owes it to their heroic devotedness, that we
should recount the martyrdom of one among them at least.</p>

<p>A Dauphinese, named Pierre Chapot, after a short sojourn
at Geneva, found employment as a compositor at Paris, and
in his hours of leisure sold religious books. A spy of the
Sorbonne surprised him in 1546, and Chapot was cited before
the <i lang="fr">Chambre ardente</i> of the Parliament. His mild air, modest
behaviour, his appeals to the justice of the counsellors, the
Bible that he invoked with such assurance, softened the
judges, and he obtained permission to enter upon a disputation
with three doctors of theology. These last acceded with
reluctance, saying that to discuss with heretics was a thing
of evil consequence.</p>

<p>Chapot relied upon scriptural texts, and the others
answered him with councils and traditions. Then, turning
to the counsellors, the prisoner begged them not to allow a
reference to anything but the declarations of the Gospel.
Cut to the quick, the Sorbonnists said to the judges: “Why
do you permit yourselves to be dictated to by a wicked and
wily heretic? Why have you brought us hither to discuss
articles already censured and condemned by the theological
faculty? We will carry our complaint before those whom it
concerns.” And they all departed deeply angered.</p>

<p>After they had left, the hawker said, with a calm voice:
“You see, gentlemen, that these people proffer no other
reasons than shouts and menaces; I want nothing more than
to persuade you of the justice of my cause.” And falling
upon his knees, with clasped hands, he implored God to
inspire all the company with a right judgment, for the
honour and glory of His name. Some of the judges, touched
with compassion, would have acquitted him. But the contrary
opinion prevailed, and the only favour he obtained,
was not to have his tongue cut out before being burned
alive.</p>

<p>He was taken to the Place Maubert, supported in a
cart by two men, for the torture had broken his limbs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
From the height of this new pulpit, he cried: “Christian
people, although you see me here carried to die like a malefactor,
and although I feel guilty of all my sins, I pray each
of you to understand, that I am now about to depart from
life like a true Christian, and not for any heresy, or because
I am without God. I believe in God the Father Almighty,
and in Jesus Christ, who, by His death, has delivered us from
everlasting death. I believe that he was conceived of the
Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary....”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the doctor Maillard, one of those
with whom he had disputed before the Parliament: “Master
Pierre,” he said to him, “it is here that you ought to implore
pardon of the Virgin Mary, whom you have so grievously
offended.” “Sir, I pray you,” replied the sufferer, “let me
speak; I will say nothing that is unfitting a good Christian.
As for the Virgin Mary, I have offended her in nothing, nor
would I wish to have done it.” “Then say but one <i lang="la">Ave
Maria</i>.” “No, I will not say it.” And he repeated without
ceasing: “Jesus, son of David, have mercy upon me.” At
this moment the doctor ordered the executioner to tighten
the cord, and the martyr gave up his soul to God.</p>

<p>After the execution, the theologians of the Sorbonne complained
loudly to the <i lang="fr">Chambre ardente</i>, and declared that if
heretics were permitted to speak, everything would be lost.
The Parliament therefore resolved that all the condemned
should have, without exception, their tongues cut out.</p>

<p>The disciples of the new religion had among them signs
of recognition; and when they were too numerous to form
one assembly, they divided themselves into <em>small bands</em>.
The most resolute, or the best informed, undertook to explain
the Bible. They were sometimes poor artisans, who made
their exhortations by turn. The meetings took place in the
evening, or at night, or in the morning, in order to escape the
eye of the enemy. Anything served for these assemblies:
a barn, a cellar, a garret, the bosom of a wood, an opening of
a rock in the mountain-side.</p>

<p>The object of assembling was in some places concealed by
means, which reveal at the same time the simplicity and the
rigour of the period. “For the purpose of these meetings,”
says Florimond de Rémond, speaking of those of Paris,
“they chose some house with secret doors, so as to be able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
on necessity to fly, and also to enter by different ways. And
he who was to preach, brought with him dice and cards, that
he might throw them upon the carpet instead of the Bible,
and conceal their deed by gaming.... The minister of
Mantes was better advised, when secretly preaching in Paris,
at the Croix-Verte, near the Louvre, he had counters and
tale-books put upon the table, in order to deceive those who
might suddenly come upon them, if they did not belong to
his flock.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>When a pastor visited, in passing, these meetings, the
rejoicing was very great. He was listened to for hours; the
symbols of the Holy Supper were received from his hands;
the persecutions they had mutually suffered told of those
which yet awaited them; and in separating, the adieus
spoken were for the scaffold and for heaven.</p>

<p>So long as a regular form of church government was not established,
and in the absence of a minister of the Gospel, the
administration of the sacrament was abstained from. Calvin
and the pastors of the Reformation would not authorize each
little assembly to receive the communion at the hands of a man
without a recognised call. “We by no means approve that
you should begin in this way, or even that you should be
hasty to have the Holy Supper, until you have an established
order among you,” wrote Calvin, in 1553, to the faithful dispersed
in Saintonge.</p>

<p>But if the sacraments were wanting at the beginning, they
preserved a great rigidity of manners and discipline. Sinners
were reproved, the erring admonished, and the authors of
scandals excluded from the communion. “They declared
themselves,” says the historian, whom I am never weary of
citing, because he seems to have well understood the disciples
of the Reformation,—“they declared themselves enemies of
luxury, of public debauches, and of the frivolities of the
world, too much in vogue among the Catholics. In their
feasts and assemblies, instead of dancing and hautboys, they
had readings from the Bibles, that were placed upon the
table, and spiritual songs, especially the Psalms put into
verse. The women, by their decent carriage and modest
dress, appeared in public like mourning Eves or repentant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Magdalens, as says Tertullian of those of his time. The men,
all subdued, seemed stricken with the Holy Ghost.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The popular opinion was not ill-founded, and Catherine de
Medicis affirmed it one day in her trifling way: “I shall
turn to the new religion, that I may pass for a pious prude.”</p>

<p>This was the most flourishing and purest period of the
French Reformation. There were, no doubt, among the
faithful, some unquiet, restless minds, who only joined it out
of an empty passion for novelty; there were among them
also many differences, which compromised the general cause,
and many lukewarm, that were called temporisers, middle-course
men, or Nicodemites. But the rivalries of the
great houses of the kingdom, and political quarrels, had not
yet mixed themselves up with religion. The Reformers
suffered, and took no vengeance; they received death without
a desire to retaliate, and displayed more severity against
themselves than their enemies.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_VIII">VIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>In a more enlightened age, the great progress of the
Reformation would soon have brought about a crisis. Unfortunately,
the minds of the people were not yet ripe, and no
one comprehended that there might be two religions at once
in the same state.</p>

<p>Francis I., besieged by women and priests, had died in
1547, little regretted by the Catholics, who reproached him
for not having done enough for the Church, and still less
regretted by the Protestants, who accused him of having
cruelly persecuted them. His son, Henry II., who succeeded
him, was nineteen years of age. His nature was mild, his
countenance open, his speech easy and ready, his manners
graceful; but he was deficient in all the high qualities of
a king. Ill instructed in business, and incapable of constant
application to it, he chiefly passed his time in diversion with
his courtiers. The government fell into the hands of
favourites of both sexes,—Anne de Montmorency, the duke
François de Guise, the Marshal de Saint André, Diane de
Poitiers, duchess of Valentinois; and it is under his reign
that the great factions, which covered France with ruins and
blood, commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Henry II., in concert with his Italian wife, Catherine de
Medicis, opened the court to the arts of magic and sorcery,
whence arose acts of the most shameful credulity amongst
some, and of cold impiety among others. “Two great sins,”
says an old historian, “crept into France in the reign of this
prince; namely, atheism and magic.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>At the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> of the coronation of the queen, in 1549,
Henry II. displayed great magnificence; and as voluptuousness
and cruelty have much natural affinity, he determined
upon combining with the pomp of the tournaments
the spectacle of the execution of four Lutherans.</p>

<p>One of them was a poor tailor, or <em>sempster</em>, who had been
thrown into prison for having worked on forbidden days,
and spoken ill words against the Church of Rome. The
king having expressed a desire to question, by way of pastime,
some one of the heretics, the Cardinal de Lorraine had
this sempster brought before him, supposing that he could
not utter a sensible word. He was deceived. The sempster
held his ground against the king and the priests with
great presence of mind. “The favourite, Diane de Poitiers,”
according to the narrative of Crespin, “would also interpose
her raillery; but the sempster soon cut her cloth in a
different fashion to that she expected. For he, not being
able to endure such inordinate arrogance in her whom he
knew to be the cause of such cruel persecutions, said to her:
‘Rest contented, Madam, that you have infected all France,
without mixing your venom and filth in so sacred and holy a
thing as the religion and truth of our Lord Jesus Christ.’”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Henry II. was so angered with this boldness, that he
resolved to see him burned alive. He placed himself, for
the purpose, at a window fronting the stake. The poor
sempster, having recognised him, turned upon him a look
so firm, so fixed, impressed with so much calm and courage,
that the king could not sustain this mute, but terrible
accusation. He withdrew, frightened, his whole soul disturbed,
and for many nights he imagined his couch <ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'was haunte by'">
was haunted by</ins> the sinister image of the victim. He swore never to be
present again at these fearful executions, and he kept his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
word. A more truly Christian prince would have abolished
them.</p>

<p>The persecution, far from ceasing, raged more strongly.
In 1551 appeared the famous Edict of Châteaubriant, which
empowered both the secular and the ecclesiastical judges separately
to take cognizance of the crime of heresy, so that by
a complete reversal of all justice, the accused absolved before
one tribunal, might be condemned before another. All intercession
on their behalf was forbidden, and the sentences
were to be executed in spite of appeal. The third of the
goods of the convicts was to go to the informers. The king
confiscated to himself the property of all those, who took
refuge out of France. It was prohibited to send money or
letters to the fugitives. And, lastly, the obligation of presenting
a certificate of Catholic orthodoxy, was imposed upon
all suspected persons. This atrocious legislation was imitated
by the men of the Reign of Terror, but with modifications.</p>

<p>The most infamous baseness ensued. Such and such a
favourite, such and <ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'such a courtezan'">
such a courtesan</ins>, obtained as the price of
the most disgraceful services, the spoils of a family, or even
of an entire canton. The property of the victims was
fought for and disputed in open day, before the whole country.
Heretics were denounced, and in default were invented, that
there might be more goods to confiscate; and many abbeys
and noble families by this means enlarged their domains, as
they did later on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
They have since lost their ill-gotten acquisitions. The judgments
of God have their day of execution!</p>

<p>The Edict of Châteaubriant was not enough. Pope
Paul IV., the Cardinal de Lorraine, the Sorbonne, a multitude
of priests, demanded that France should become a land
of inquisition. A bull to this effect was despatched in
1557, and the king confirmed it by an edict. But in vain
did he attempt to force it upon the Parliament in session:
the lay magistrates temporized, adjourned, and in the midst
of so many disgraces, France was spared this one at least.</p>

<p>Exasperated by these delays, the impetuous Paul IV.,
whose head, it is said, was deranged with old age, fulminated
a bull, in which he declared that all who lapsed into heresy,
prelates, princes, even kings and emperors, should be shorn of
their benefices, dignities, states, and empires, which he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
bestow upon the first Catholic occupant, without even retaining
to the Holy See the power of restitution. Paul IV.
mistook the age: under the pontificate of Gregory VII. or
of Innocent III., such a bull would have set all Europe on
fire; under his, it was only an act of folly.</p>

<p>But in default of the Inquisition, the Sorbonne and the
clergy, who had constituted hatred of heretics the first,
and the most sacred of duties, neglected nothing to inflame
every mind with implacable fanaticism. Its effects may be
seen in the affair of the Rue Saint Jacques, which happened
in the beginning of the month of September, 1557.</p>

<p>The battle of Saint Quentin had just been lost. Arms had
been distributed among the people with orders to be ready
for any event. Every one fancied the Spaniard at the gates
of Paris, and general terror ascribed the disaster to the mildness
with which the heretics had been treated. “We have
not sufficiently avenged the honour of God, and God takes
vengeance upon us,” cried with the same voice both the populace
and churchmen. So, when Rome was attacked by the
barbarians, the Pagans accused themselves of having been
too considerate towards the Christians. So, when Paris was
menaced in 1792, after the taking of Verdun, the self-accusation
was that the aristocracy and clergy had been too much
spared, and the result was the days of September. The
raging of the passions is always the same.</p>

<p>Three or four hundred of the faithful had met together
one evening to celebrate the Supper, in a house of the Rue
Saint Jacques, behind the Sorbonne. Among them were
many gentlemen and men of the law. The ladies belonged,
with the exception of four or five, to noble families; many
of them were of the court.</p>

<p>Some bachelors or doctors of theology, lodging at the
Sorbonne, had watched and given the signal of alarm.
Fearing lest the assembly might separate before they were
sufficiently strong in numbers, they had heaped up a great
quantity of stones to overwhelm those who should come
out. About midnight, the service being over, the faithful
opened the door; but, at the threshold, they were assailed
with a shower of missiles accompanied by frightful vociferations,
and were compelled to retreat within.</p>

<p>The whole quarter was awakened by the tumult. The cry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
“to arms” was raised. Sinister rumours agitated the crowd.
“Have the Spaniards surprised the town?” “No, not yet;”
some replied, “but there are wretches who have sold the
kingdom.” “Not so,” answered others, “they are Lutherans,
damnable heretics, who rejoice in the misfortunes of France.
Death, death to the heretics!” The street was filled with
men armed with halberts, pikes, javelins, arquebuses, with
everything that came to hand.</p>

<p>The faithful, momentarily expecting to be massacred, fell
upon their knees and supplicated God to come to their aid.
Then they deliberated upon what they should do. To barricade
themselves until the arrival of the serjeants, would be to
devote themselves to almost certain death. To cut a passage
through that furious multitude was scarcely less perilous.
Upon this, however, the most daring decided, persuaded
that the only way to daunt their adversaries was to front them
boldly. The gentlemen drew their swords and marched foremost:
the others followed. They traversed the crowd in the
midst of a shower of stones, and through the pikes of their
assailants. Favoured by the night, they escaped with their
lives, though sorely wounded. One alone fell; he was trodden
underfoot, and so mutilated as to have lost all likeness
to the human form.</p>

<p>But what was the fate of those who had not the courage
to leave the building? They were nearly all women and children.
They sought to fly by the garden, but all the issues
were watched. At break of day they tried to gain the street, but
were beaten and driven back. The women, counting upon the
pity their helplessness commanded, presented themselves at
the windows and with clasped hands implored the compassion
of the wretches who had begun to force the doors; but they
might as successfully have supplicated rocks as these pitiless
miscreants. Already, offering back their life to God, they
were preparing to die, when in the morning, the civil-lieutenant
arrived with a troop of serjeants.</p>

<p>He inquired into the cause of the disturbance, and learning
that the meeting had been held for reading the Bible, to
celebrate the Supper, to pray for the king and the prosperity
of the kingdom, he was moved to tears. Yet he must acquit
himself of his duty. He had the men brought forth first bound
two and two: they were insulted and beaten, those above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
all who, by their beards or their long dresses, seemed to be
preachers. He would have kept the women in the house;
but the populace threatened to fire it. They came out in
their turn, to be overwhelmed with cowardly outrages, their
clothes rent to shreds, their hair torn from their heads,
to reach the prison of the Châtelet, covered with dirt and
gore, to the number of about a hundred and forty victims.</p>

<p>The most execrable aspersions were hawked about against
the new believers, in the pulpits, in the confessionals, in the
colleges, in the market-places, at the court itself. Invention
had not been much taxed: it was word for word the old
calumnies of the Pagans against the meetings of the early
Christians. The heretics were accused of not believing in
God, of immolating little children, of extinguishing the
lights.... I desist from saying more: let the history of the
primitive church be read!</p>

<p>And as it seems necessary that in human affairs the ridiculous
should always place itself beside the tragic, a certain
bishop of Avranches distributed a tract throughout all Paris,
in which, comparing the sound of the bells of the Catholic
service to that of the arquebuses which had interrupted the
Lutheran worship, he detailed a tissue of antitheses: “The
bells ring, and the arquebuses thunder; those have a soft
sound, and these a sound of fear; those open heaven, these
open hell....” And thence this prelatical buffoon inferred
that (Roman) Catholicism has all the signs of the true church.</p>

<p>The Reformers published apologies, which they secretly
scattered abroad, even in the king’s chamber. But they sought
in vain for a serious inquiry. Their enemies did not by
any means desire this; they judged it better to applaud the
bands of wretches, who, crowding each day to the places
appointed for capital punishments, shouted with bloodthirsty
cries, “Death to the heretics!”</p>

<p>Before the end of September, three prisoners were brought
to the scaffold: an old man, a young one, and a woman,
Madame de Graveron, of the family of Luns, in Périgord.
She was only twenty-three years of age, and had been a
widow but a few months. On quitting the prison for the
scene of execution, she exchanged her mourning weeds, says
Crespin, for the velvet hood and other festal garments, as if
to receive a happy triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>After these three victims, four others were sacrificed. But
by this time, Protestant Europe had been stirred up by the
voice of Calvin and of Farel. The Swiss cantons, the
County Palatine, the elector of Saxony, the duke of Wurtemburg,
the marquis of Brandenburg, interceded for the prisoners.
Henry II. wanted the support of the Protestants,
and granted their request. Everything in this affair was
therefore to overflow with disgrace, even down to the act
of amnesty wrenched from a king of France by the intervention
of the foreigner.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_IX">IX.</h3>
</div>


<p>Beaten without by the most violent storms, the French
Reformation did not neglect anything by which it might
strengthen itself within. Its organization was necessarily
long defective and incomplete. At first, as we have seen, there
were simple gatherings, without fixed pastors or regular administration
of the sacraments. No churches then existed, in
the dogmatic sense of the word, but only the seeds and scattered
elements of churches. This lasted about thirty years.</p>

<p>Then the flocks had a consistory, ministers, a stable
authority, a recognised discipline. The example had been
set by the faithful of Paris, in 1555. A gentleman who
received them at his house, M. de la Ferrière, proposed that
they should appoint a pastor. Many objections were urged;
but his representations prevailed, and the meeting nominated
a minister, elders, and deacons. The same organization was
adopted at Poitiers, Angers, Bourges, and other places. And
thus was constituted the local church or ecclesiastical community.</p>

<p>A great step remained to be taken. The churches were
isolated and independent of each other. They were to be
confederated and united into one general church, whether
for the maintenance of unity of belief and discipline, or to
oppose a stronger barrier against the attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p>Such was the subject of the discussion, held with his colleagues,
by the pastor Antoine de Chandieu, who had come
to Poitiers from Paris about the end of the year 1558. All
resolved upon convoking a general synod as soon as possible
at Paris, with the consent of the consistory, “not to
attribute any pre-eminence or dignity to that church,” as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Theodore de Bèze expressly observes, “but because it was
then the most convenient town for collecting secretly a great
number of ministers and elders.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In face of the gibbets erected on the public places, and of
the sanguinary laws that crushed the Reformers, the difficulties
of executing their project were immense. The result
was, that only thirteen churches sent their deputies to this
synod: Paris, Saint Lô, Dieppe, Angers, Orleans, Tours,
Poitiers, Saintes, Marennes, Châtellerault, Saint Jean d’Angély.
These delegates assembled under the presidency of
the pastor François Morel, lord of Collonges, the 25th of
May, 1559.</p>

<p>There was in the deliberations of this assembly a simplicity
and moral grandeur that fill us with respect. Nothing of
declamation or violence, but a calm dignity, a tranquil and
serene force prevailed, as if the members of the synod debated
in a profound peace, under the guardianship of the laws. And
yet the historian De Thou says that they braved an almost
certain death! Much admiration has been bestowed upon
the constituent assembly for its resumption of the discussion
upon a judiciary law, after the flight of Louis XVI.; here
the spectacle is much more grand, for it required far more
energy and self-denial.</p>

<p>The foundations of the French Reformation were then
laid. Ensuing synods have only changed a few terms of
the confession of faith, and developed points of discipline.
The essential was established at the first stroke. The dogmatic
and ecclesiastical code were the expression of what
has been called Calvinism. Our task must be here only
that of the narrator.</p>

<p>The confession of faith was composed of forty articles,
embracing all the dogmas, considered fundamental in the
sixteenth century. God and His word; the Trinity; the fall
of man and his state of condemnation; the decree of the
Lord towards the elect; gratuitous redemption through
Jesus Christ, very God and very man; participation in
this grace through the faith given by the Holy Ghost; the
characters of the true church; the number and signification
of the Sacraments. The Bible was taken as the sole and
absolute rule of all truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>The discipline also contained forty articles. It has been
since extended in the synodal assemblies; and it has ended
by a division into fourteen chapters or sections, comprising
two hundred and twenty articles; but all the chief ideas
were in the primitive draft.</p>

<p>We will give a short glance at this ecclesiastical constitution.
Wherever there were a sufficient number of the faithful,
they were to constitute themselves into a church; that is
to say, to name a consistory, appoint a minister, establish the
regular celebration of the sacraments and the practice of
discipline. Everything was to be begun with this first step.</p>

<p>The consistory was elected at first by the common voice of
the people; it was completed afterwards by the suffrages of
its own members; but the new selections were always to be
submitted for the approval of the flock, and if there were
any opposition, the debate was to be settled either at the
colloquy or at the provincial synod. To be eligible for the consistory
imposed no condition of fortune, or of any other kind.</p>

<p>The election of the pastors was notified to the people in the
same way, after having been made by the provincial synod
or the colloquy. The newly elected minister preached during
three consecutive Sundays. The silence of the people was held
to signify their consent. If there were any reclamations,
these were carried before the bodies charged with the choice
of pastors. There was no further appeal against the voice of
the majority.</p>

<p>A certain number of churches formed the conscription of a
colloquy. The colloquies assembled twice a year at least.
Each church was represented by a pastor and an elder. The
office of these companies was to arrange any difficulties that
might arise, and generally to provide for whatever was conformable
to the welfare of their flocks.</p>

<p>Beyond the colloquies were the provincial synods, also composed
of a pastor and an elder of each church. They assembled
once in each year at least. They decided upon whatever
had not been settled in the colloquies, and upon all the
important matters of their province. The number of these
synods has varied. Sixteen has been the general number,
since the union of Béarn to France.</p>

<p>Lastly, at the summit of the hierarchy was placed the national
synod. It was, whenever it was possible, to be convoked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
year by year; which, however, scarcely ever took place, owing
to the misfortunes of the times.</p>

<p>Composed of two pastors, and of two elders of each particular
synod, the national synod was the supreme court for
all great ecclesiastical matters, and every one was bound to
render it obedience. The deliberations commenced by reading
the confession of faith and of discipline. The members of
the assembly must adhere to the first, but might propose
amendments of the other. The presidency belonged of right
to a pastor. The duration of the sessions was indeterminate.
Before the closing of each session, the province in which the
following synod would be holden, was designated.</p>

<p>This constitution had been dictated by Calvin. It attests
the power and extent of his genius for organization.
Throughout the whole the elective principle was the guarantee
of liberty; throughout the whole power supported authority;
and thence, order arose from the combination of these two elements.
Moreover, an equilibrium between the pastors and the
laity was preserved; the periodical and frequent renewal of
provincial and national synods was settled; and churches
were strongly united without the least trace of primacy. It
was a Presbyterian government in its essential features. In
these times it would, doubtless, be required that the part of
the people should not be limited to a simple right of veto,
and that the number of the laity should prevail over that of
the pastors in the different degrees of jurisdiction. But if
we recur to the ideas which were current in the sixteenth
century, it will be seen that this ecclesiastical charter immensely
surpassed the civil institutions. The principle of the
equality of believers, pastors or laymen, great or little, was at
its base, and out of this naturally arose the equality of the
citizens; for the State and the Church ever tend to be, in
their respective attributes, the counterpart of each other.</p>

<p>We must add, that all these elective bodies, from the consistories
to the national synod, formed a sort of jury, which
had authority to take cognisance of private errors, and to
inflict spiritual penalties. These penalties were individual
admonition, remonstrance in consistory, suspension from the
Lord’s Supper, and lastly, for great scandals, excommunication
and excision from the Church. The heads of the highest must
bend like the most humble, under this religious penalty, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
in certain cases, make public confession of their offences.
Henry IV., already king of Navarre, submitted to it on
more than one occasion.</p>

<p>We are astonished in our times at this interference with
private actions; but in those days few people thought of
complaining. The ecclesiastical power penetrated without
obstacle and without effort into fireside life. It was believed
that the religious law ought to inquire into the faults
which the civil law could not reach, and for the Reformers
it was still more requisite that they should have recourse to
this kind of penalty, as they were accused of having left the
Romish church only the more unrestrictedly to satisfy their
passions.</p>

<p>On the 29th of May, 1559, when the deputies of the first
general synod, before separating, mingled their souls in
prayer, that they might bless God for the work he had permitted
them to accomplish, the French Reformation was constituted.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_X">X.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Parliament of Paris began to exhibit signs of hesitation
before the growing host of the Calvinists. It had split
into three parties: the ultra-Catholics, headed by the chief
president, Gilles Lemaître, who were bent upon persisting in
the old system of persecution; the men of middle course,
already styled Politicians, among whom figured Christophe de
Harlay, Seguier, and De Thou, the father of the historian,
who sought to approximate the two religions by mutual
concessions; lastly, the secret Reformers, whose chiefs were
Anne Dubourg and Louis Dubourg, who from day to day
declared themselves more openly. These divisions produced
between the two chambers a diversity of jurisprudence, the
great chamber continuing to pursue the heretics with severity,
and the Tournelle seeking means to acquit them.</p>

<p>These symptoms of indulgence alarmed the clergy. “If
the secular arm fails in its duty,” said the Cardinal de
Lorraine to the king, “all the malcontents will throw themselves
into this detestable sect; they will destroy the ecclesiastical
power, and afterwards it will be the turn of the
regal power.”</p>

<p>Henry II. listened to him with greater readiness, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
he had just concluded with the king of Spain the shameful
peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, when the two monarchs engaged
by a secret article, to exterminate heresy; and as a pledge
of this treaty, his daughter Elizabeth was to espouse
Philip II. It was therefore arranged that the king should
go in person to the Parliament, in order to put an end
at once to the divisions by an act of authority. It was also,
as the cardinal further observed, the most agreeable exhibition
to offer to the Spanish ambassadors, who had arrived in
Paris to fetch away the betrothed princess, to burn before the
people half a dozen Lutheran counsellors. “We must,” to use
his expression, “give this junket to these grandees of Spain.”</p>

<p>Henry II. proceeded to hold a bed of justice, on the 10th
of August, 1559, and invited the counsellors to give him
frankly their advice upon the means of appeasing the religious
differences. The chief president, Gilles Lemaître, lauded
the zeal of Philip Augustus, who had in one day caused six
hundred of the Albigenses to be burned. The men of middle
course confined themselves to vague generalities. The secret
Calvinists, Anne Dubourg in particular, demanded religious
reforms by means of a national council. “Every day,” said
he, “we see committed crimes that go unpunished, while
new torments are invented against men who have committed
no crime. It is not a matter of little importance to condemn
those who, in the midst of the flames, invoke the name
of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>The irritated prince ordered him to be arrested in full Parliament,
by the captain of his guards, and said aloud, that
he would see him burned with his own eyes. But wounded,
by the splinter of a lance, in a tournament, he died a month
afterwards; and we are assured that in his last moments he
remembered Anne Dubourg with grief, and the other counsellors
confined in the Bastille. “They are innocent,” he
cried, “and God punishes me for having persecuted them.”
The Cardinal de Lorraine hastened to quiet his conscience,
by saying that this was a suggestion of the devil.</p>

<p>Anne Dubourg was born, in 1521, at Riom, in Auvergne,
and belonged to a family of consideration. His uncle had
been chancellor of France. After having studied theology,
received orders, and entered the law at Orleans, he occupied,
since the year 1557, a seat in the Parliament of Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
He was a man of great learning, integrity, and devotion to
his duties; and the only accusation that could be brought
against him was, that he had sided with the new religion.</p>

<p>The death of the king did not suspend his trial. The
bishop of Paris had him degraded from his orders, and, contrary
to custom, the matter was brought, not before the
assembled chambers, but commissioners. Some magistrates
would have persuaded him to make a confession of faith in ambiguous
terms, so that, without wounding his own conscience,
he might satisfy that of the judges. Dubourg refused: he
even disavowed his advocate Marillac, who had defended him
with equivocal phrases, and he was condemned to be burned
alive.</p>

<p>He heard his sentence read without a change of countenance,
and prayed God to pardon his judges. “Happen
what will,” said he, “I am a Christian; yes, I am a Christian;
and I will shout still louder, dying for the glory of my Lord
Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>As the Reformers had tried to provide him with the
means of escape, he was inclosed in an iron cage, an old
implement of Louis XI.’s fetched from the Bastille. Dubourg’s
resignation was not disturbed: he sang the praises of God
in this narrow prison.</p>

<p>It was the usage to reserve for grand occasions the execution
of criminals of the deepest dye, and that of Anne Dubourg
was fixed for the 23rd of December, 1559, the day
before Christmas-eve. Six hundred men were put under
arms. The crossways of the streets were even inclosed
with strong posts and barriers, in order that the place of
execution might not be ascertained until the last hour. Dubourg
wished to divest himself of his clothes: “My friends,”
said he to the people, “I am not here to die like a thief, or a
murderer, but for the Gospel.” He was offered a crucifix, but
he rejected it, and when suspended on the gibbet he cried:
“My God, my God, forsake me not, that I may not forsake
Thee.”</p>

<p>Thus died, at the age of thirty-eight, this pious and illustrious
magistrate. “His execution,” says Mézeray, “inspired
many persons with the conviction that the belief professed
by so good and so enlightened a man, could not be evil;”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and Florimond de Rémond, then a student, avows that
every one in the colleges was moved to tears, that they
pleaded his cause after his death, and that this execution did
more harm than a hundred ministers could have done with
all their preaching.</p>

<p>The year following, the Chancellor Olivétan pronounced
the name of Anne Dubourg with despair upon his death-bed;
and on the approach of the Cardinal de Lorraine, he
said to him: “Ah! Cardinal, thou hast caused the damnation
of us all.”</p>

<p>In the midst of these persecutions, the affairs of the
nation were daily becoming more critical. The new king,
Francis II., was hardly six years old. Feeble in body and
mind, his person, according to the energetic expression of
an old historian, was exposed to the first occupant. Catherine
de Medicis, the Guises, Châtillons, Bourbons, the Constable
Anne de Montmorency, all worked to their own advantage
this impotent fiction of the royalty of a child, and mingled
with the religious discussions, the quarrels of their political
ambition. We shall only speak of that which is immediately
connected with our subject.</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis, who had now been in France six-and-twenty
years, had brought from the country of Machiavelli
the art of dissimulation, for which she had found such
ample opportunity of exercise during the long humiliations,
to which she had been subjected under the reign of the female
favourites of Henry II. Artful and vindictive, licentious
without having even the excuse of passion, ambitious of power,
as much from the love of intrigue as from the pride of command,
she had, nevertheless, abilities of a high order, which,
directed to the pursuit of a good object, might have accomplished
great designs; but having no longer either faith or
moral feeling, and constantly engaged in ruining the authority
of others in order to consolidate her own, she by turns embraced
and deserted all parties alike. No wife and mother
of our kings, Isabeau de Bavière excepted, has done so much
injury to France as this Italian.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>The Guises, even more than Catherine de Medicis, were
during forty years the real leaders of the (Roman) Catholic
party in France, and without them, as Mézeray remarks, the
new religion would perhaps have become dominant. This
family, which was a younger branch of that of the dukes of
Lorraine, had only established itself in France since the
reign of Louis XII. Claude de Lorraine came hither in
1513, to seek his fortune, <em>with a valet and a walking-stick</em>.
He had by Antoinette de Bourbon six sons and four daughters,
who all succeeded in raising themselves to offices of
consideration.</p>

<p>Francis I. distrusted them in the latter days of his life,
and counselled his son to keep the Lorraines at a distance;
but Henry II. had too little haughtiness of mind and force
of character to follow this wise counsel. He allowed these
foreigners, who had interests quite distinct from those of his
race and kingdom, to get into their hands the public business;
and after the accession of Francis II., who espoused
their niece Mary Stuart, two years older than himself, the
Guises became all-powerful.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, archbishop of Rheims,
and the possessor, in ecclesiastical benefices, of a revenue of
three hundred thousand crowns (many millions of our present
money), had some learning, affable manners, great facility
of speech, and much dexterity in the management of
men and affairs, a deep policy, and a vast ambition. He
aspired to nothing less than the crown of France for his
brother, and to the tiara for himself. So, Pius V., somewhat
anxious concerning the part he was playing in the Church,
habitually called him the pope on the other side of the
mountains. For the rest, he was a priest without settled
convictions, and half preached the Confession of Augsburg,
<em>to please my good masters the Germans</em>, as says Brantôme;
he was decried for his evil habits, which he did not even care
to hide, and raised the hooting of the populace on quitting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
dwelling of a courtesan; lastly, he was as pusillanimous in
the face of danger, as he was arrogant in prosperity.</p>

<p>His brother, the Duke François de Guise, less informed, and
less eloquent, had higher qualities. A great warrior, intrepid
and liberal, he had served France nobly at the defence of Metz,
the capture of Calais and Thionville, and the victory of Renty.
His character was naturally elevated and generous, but
irascible, even cruel, when he encountered an obstacle; and
as he comprehended nothing of religious controversies or
of political diplomacy, he placed his valiant sword at the
service of the cardinal.</p>

<p>The two brothers were in a favourable position for reciprocally
assisting, without interfering with each other. The
one could not hope for the crown of France, nor could the
other expect the tiara. The priest gained for their house the
support of the churchmen, and the soldier, that of the military.
Abroad they were aided by Philip II. and the Holy
See, and these foreigners contracted alliances with foreigners,
not as subjects, but as sovereigns.</p>

<p>Under Francis II. the cardinal got himself named Superintendent
of the Exchequer. The Duke de Guise obtained,
notwithstanding the protestations of the Constable, the command-in-chief
of the army; and being at the same time
grand chamberlain, master of the hounds, grand master,
generalissimo, uncle of a king of sixteen, and brother of the
cardinal, he wielded an authority at least as great as that of
the ancient mayors of the palace.</p>

<p>On the other side were the Bourbons, princes of the blood,
but in a distant degree, of narrow fortune, and suspected by
the Crown since the treason of the ancient Constable, who had
taken arms against his king.</p>

<p>Antoine de Bourbon, the head of his race, had espoused
Jeanne d’Albret, who had conferred upon him the title of
king of Navarre, without giving him the kingdom. He was
an irresolute, indolent prince; and, timid by character, though
occasionally courageous, he floated between the two doctrines,
sometimes causing the Reformed faith to be preached in
Béarn, Saintonge, and Poitou, and going to sing psalms at the
Pré-aux-Clercs, in 1558, in spite of the shouts of the Sorbonne;
sometimes returning towards the (Roman) Catholic
religion and persecuting the faithful. The first and last passion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of his life was to recover the kingdom of Navarre, or equivalent
domains. He died without succeeding, and this long
dream only begat for him the mockery and desertion of every
one.</p>

<p>His brother, the prince Louis de Condé, had a more penetrating
genius and a more masculine character. Witty,
merry, sometimes trifling, but intrepid above all, and loved
by the soldiery, he valiantly defended the cause of the
Reformers, without ever inspiring them with full confidence.
Instructed in the new opinions by his wife and his stepmother,
he showed more ambition than religion, and the looseness of
his manners has always left a doubt upon the sincerity of
his faith.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether the Bourbons, Henry IV. included,
did not damage more than profit the French Reformation.
They launched it into politics, drove it into the
battle-field, dragged it into their particular quarrels; and
then, when it had gained them the crown, they denied it.</p>

<p>Another family, less high in rank, but more eminent for
its virtues,—that of the Châtillons, served the cause with
more fidelity. It consisted of three brothers: Odet de Châtillon,
François d’Andelot, and Gaspard de Coligny. Their
mother, Louise de Montmorency, sister of the Constable,
leaned to the Reformation. She was virtuous, in those times
of license, a rare example of chastity. In her dying moments
she refused the presence of a priest, saying that God
had given her the grace of fearing and loving Him.</p>

<p>François d’Andelot, the youngest of the three brothers,
was the first to declare himself frankly for the new religion.
Made prisoner in the wars of Italy, and detained in the
castle of Milan, he had received some pious books from the
hands of Rénée de France. Sent afterwards to Scotland, he
had the opportunity of studying more closely the doctrine
and practices of the Reformation. He was a brave and
loyal knight, without fear or reproach, the worthy successor
of Bayard.</p>

<p>Going to Brittany, where the property of his house was
situated, he took with him a pastor who preached from town
to town, with open doors: an unheard-of thing in 1558.
Henry II. reproached him sharply for it. “Sire,” answered
D’Andelot, “you must not think it strange that, after doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
my duty in your service, I employ the rest of my time for
the safety of my soul. Wherefore I supplicate you to leave
my conscience safe, and to keep for your service my body
and my goods, which are entirely yours.” “But I did not
give you that order,” said the king, pointing to the collar
about his neck, “to use it thus. You have promised and
sworn to go to mass and to follow your religion.” “I did not
then know,” replied the knight in his integrity, “what it
was to be a Christian, and I would not have accepted it on
that condition, had God touched my heart as He has since.”</p>

<p>The king, who could contain himself no longer, threw
across the table his plate, which struck the dauphin, and he
would have pierced D’Andelot with his sword. He had
him imprisoned, and took away from him his commission of
colonel-general of the infantry, which was given to Blaise de
Montluc.</p>

<p>This matter made a great noise. Calvin wrote to the
prisoner to felicitate him on his courage, and Pope Paul IV.
was indignant that the offender had not been led straight to
execution. The ambassador of France represented to him
in vain that it was out of the question to treat a Châtillon
in this way, the nephew of the Constable, the brother of the
Admiral. The intractable pontiff exclaimed, “A heretic never
repents; it is an evil for which there is no remedy but the fire.”</p>

<p>Relations and friends intervened; D’Andelot consented
to allow a mass to be said in the chamber of his prison, but
without taking any part in it, and he was set at liberty.</p>

<p>Gaspard de Coligny, the greatest layman of the French
Reformation, will detain us longer. We shall endeavour
above all to describe the religious side of his character, and
the details of private life neglected by other historians.</p>

<p>Born at Châtillon-sur-Loing in 1516, Coligny received his
education from Nicolas Bérault, a renowned professor of the
age, and he exhibited such taste for his studies, that he was
compelled to interrupt them, lest he should be turned from
the career of arms. At twenty-five he was made colonel-general
of the French infantry, and through his regulations
he introduced a severe discipline among these bands of mercenaries,
who before his time were more like brigands than
soldiers. “These ordinances,” says Brantôme, “were the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
most elegant and the wisest that were ever made in France,
and I believe that since they were made, the lives of a million
of persons have been preserved, and as much of their
goods and faculties; for before there was nothing but pillage,
theft, brigandage, ransomings, murders, quarrels, and disorder
among these bands. This, then, is the obligation the world
owes to this eminent person.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>At what time Coligny made the first step towards the
new doctrine is not known. From the year 1555, we find
him seconding the enterprise of the Chevalier de Villegagnon,
for founding a colony of French Reformers in Brazil. The
Admiral, who perceived in the proposal the twofold advantage
of opening a place of retreat for the persecuted people, and
of enriching his country with a colonial establishment, gave
Villegagnon two ships with a sum of ten thousand livres:
the expedition, however, did not succeed.</p>

<p>Taken prisoner by the Spaniards after the disastrous battle
of Saint Quentin, he asked for a Bible and other religious
books. He gave himself wholly up to this study, and it was
then that he seems to have acquired firm and deep convictions
upon the principles of the Reformation.</p>

<p>When he had paid his ransom, he retired to his manor of
Châtillon-sur-Loing; and wishing to apply himself to religious
matters, he resigned to his brother D’Andelot, with the
king’s permission, the appointment of colonel-general of the
infantry. He also gave up in favour of his cousin, the Marshal
de Montmorency, son of the Constable, the government
of Paris and the Isle of France, and besought Henry II. in
the most earnest manner, to designate a successor for his
government of Picardy. “All which from that time,” says
the author of the <cite lang="fr">Mémoires de Coligny</cite>, “led many to suspect
that he had changed his religion: it being true that he
made it evident his mind was altogether drawn off from all
coveting of honour and power.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Yet this is the man, whom several historians have accused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of taking up arms and fomenting rebellions from a spirit
of ambition! History thus written is one of the darkest
shames of humanity.</p>

<p>Coligny was encouraged in his pious resolutions by Charlotte
de Laval, his wife, who never ceased to invite him to
declare himself openly. “Wherefore the Admiral, seeing himself
pressed by her so often and with so much affection, resolved
to tell her once for all, how it really was with him, representing
in the fullest manner that, for many years, he had neither
seen nor heard say of any one, whether in Germany or in France,
who had made open profession of the religion, that they had
not been overwhelmed with evils and calamities; that by the
edicts of Francis I. and of Henry II., rigorously observed by
the Parliament, those who were convicted were to be burned
alive by a slow fire in public, and their property confiscated
to the king; that notwithstanding, if she were bent so confidently
upon not refusing the condition common to those of
the (Reformed) religion, he on his part would not be found
wanting in his duty.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Charlotte de Laval having answered that this had been
the lot of true Christians in all ages, Coligny hesitated no
longer. He professed his creed before those who came to
visit him, exhorted his servants to follow his example, gave
them the Scriptures to read, engaged men of piety to govern
his children, and entirely reformed the habits of his house.
He also began to frequent the meetings, but he did not participate
yet in the Supper, having doubts upon this matter.
He had discussed the point with learned ministers, asking
for explanations upon the real presence and other similar
subjects, without having seen his way clear in this doctrine.</p>

<p>One day, therefore, being at a meeting at Vatteville, he
rose, when the Supper was about to be celebrated; and after
having beseeched the congregation not to take offence at
his infirmity, he invited the minister to explain himself a
little more at length upon the matter. “The Admiral, instructed
by his discourse, first returned thanks to God,
and from that time resolved to participate in this sacred
and holy mystery on the first day of its celebration. The
news of this having been spread throughout France, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
impossible to describe the joy and consolation all the
churches thence received.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>He persevered during his whole life in his pious habits, and
practised them more freely, as the liberty of the believers
gradually enlarged. “As soon as he left his bed, early in
the morning, having taken his dressing-gown and knelt with
all his household, he himself repeated prayers in the customary
form of the churches of France; after which, pending
the interval before the hour of preachment, which took place
every second day with psalm-singing, he gave audiences to
the deputies from the churches who had been sent to him, or
occupied himself on public matters, of which he continued
still to treat awhile after the sermon, until dinner-hour.</p>

<p>“Standing at the table, with his wife by his side, a psalm
was sung, if there had been no preaching, and then followed
the ordinary benediction: of which an infinity, not only of
Frenchmen, but of German captains and colonels, can bear
testimony of his having kept this observance, without a single
intermission, not only in his house and at his ease, but also
when with the army. The cloth having been removed, he,
rising with all present, then returned thanks himself, or had
them returned by his minister.”</p>

<p>The same thing was practised at supper; and perceiving
that all his household could not without inconvenience be
present in the evening at bedtime, he ordered that every
one should come at the conclusion of supper, and that when
the psalms had been sung, prayers should be said. And it
would not be easy to say how many of the French nobility
began to establish in their families this devout rule of the
Admiral, who often exhorted them to the true practice of
piety, saying that it was not enough that the father of a
family lived holily and religiously, if he did not by his example
induce others to follow the same rule.</p>

<p>“When it was near the time of supper, he summoned all
his people, representing to them that he would not have to
render to God an account of his own life only, but also of
their conduct, and he reconciled them together, if there had
happened to be any dissension among them.”</p>

<p>“He was of the middle height, his limbs were well-proportioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
his countenance calm and serene, his voice soft
and pleasing, but rather slow and hesitating, his complexion
clear, his carriage and demeanour grave, yet full of grace and
kindness. Of wine, he drank very little; he ate sparingly,
and slept, at the most, but seven hours.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The character that Gaspard de Coligny displayed in public
affairs, is familiar to all. Endowed with qualities the most
diverse, and of the highest order, severe toward himself indulgent
to others, never inflated by prosperity nor cast down
by misfortune, a lover of his country, devoted to his king in
whatever did not contravene his conscience, the most illustrious
statesmen, as well as the most able captains, have esteemed it
an honour to be compared with him. Perhaps he had defects
in these qualities. He appeared to be sometimes wanting in
resolution, because he was too loyal to pursue to the utmost
his advantages against royalty, and to be sometimes wanting
in foresight, because he suspected with difficulty in others that
perfidy which he found not in his own heart.</p>

<p>If we search in times near our own, and in a different
system of things, for a parallel character with his, we shall,
doubtless, pronounce the name of General Lafayette. The
man of the sixteenth century and he of the eighteenth had
a full belief in the justice of their cause. Each made the
most generous sacrifices to it, and to the end adhered to it
with the most unshaken constancy. Both had in their
hands, on many occasions, the greatest interests of the state.
Both were held to be the most honourable persons of their
age. But Lafayette had the popular masses with him;
Coligny had against him three-fourths of France; and
also, with a higher political and military genius, he had less
success.</p>

<p>The third brother, Odet de Châtillon, was the eldest of the
family. Made by Clement VII. a cardinal at seventeen, he
demanded reforms without completely adopting the Reformation.
He ended by marrying a lady of a noble house,
Isabelle de Hauteville, who was styled <i lang="fr">Madame la Cardinal</i>,
or <i lang="fr">Madame la Comtesse de Beauvais</i>, when she took her
seat in the apartments of the court in the quality of wife of a
peer of France: a curious singularity, even in that time!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Odet de Châtillon died in England some years after, being
poisoned by one of his servants. Brantôme and De Thou
speak in high terms of his judgment and integrity.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_XI">XI.</h3>
</div>


<p>Catherine de Medicis had expressed in her days of disappointment
some sentiments favourable to the Reformation, and
those of the (new) religion supposed at first that she would lend
them her support with her son Francis II. Coligny and other
Calvinist lords wrote to her that they hoped to find in her
a second Esther. But her favourable disposition was only
apparent. “I comprehend nothing of this doctrine,” she
would say; “what enlisted my sympathy for them, was
rather my woman’s pity and compassion than a desire to be
informed if their doctrine were true or false.”</p>

<p>In concert with the queen-mother and the court of
Madrid, the Guises held the Bourbons in the background,
and sent forth new edicts for exterminating heretics. In
each Parliament <i lang="fr">chambres ardentes</i> were instituted, so called
because they condemned to the fire without pity, all those
who were accused of the crime of heresy. There was a
vast system of terror, where even the shadow of justice no
longer appeared. Delations, confiscations, pillages, sentences
of death, atrocious executions—the same scenes affrighted
in the beginning of 1560, the principal towns of France,—Toulouse,
Bordeaux, Lyons, Grenoble, Poitiers, and their
dependent provinces.</p>

<p>At Paris, the commissaries of the quarters made daily
visits to the suspected houses. One Démochères, or Mouchy,
who has given the French language the term of <i lang="fr">mouchard</i>
(spy), took the field with a band of wretches, whose object
was to surprise the heretics eating meat on the prohibited
days, or assembling in meetings. They kept particular
watch on the Faubourg Saint Germain, which at that time
received the name of Little Geneva.</p>

<p>Many persons were seized and maltreated. Those, who were
able to fly, quitted the place, leaving furniture, money, provisions,
all their goods, at the mercy of the bandits, who were
intrusted with the office of serjeants; and houses were pillaged
and sacked, according to the relation of Theodore de Bèze, as in
a town taken by assault; the rabble gleaned and devastated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
what the first plunderers had omitted to take. “But what
was most to be deplored,” adds this historian, “was to see
the poor little children, who had no dwelling but the flagstones,
crying, ahungered, in the most piteous manner, and
begging about the streets, without any one daring to relieve
or shelter them, for fear of falling into the like danger; so
that they were less cared for than dogs.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Abominable contrivances had been put to work to fan the
fury of the people of Paris. There may be still seen, in
old collections, engravings which represent the heretics slaying
priests with the arquebuse, casting monks into the water,
slaughtering children, strangling women and old men, and
persons were posted about the public squares to comment
upon these infamies.</p>

<p>The people answered these dastard provocations by erecting
images of the Virgin at the corners of the streets. They
scrutinized the countenances of the passengers, and woe to
him who did not lift his hat! woe to him who refused to put
a piece of money into the trunks, or <i lang="fr">épargne-mailles</i>, which
were held out to him in order to provide for the payment of
the tapers! The shout of “A heretic!” was raised; he
was dragged to the Châtelet, and the prisons were so
crowded that it was necessary to hurry the executions, that
new victims might be accommodated.</p>

<p>One trait will depict the state of feeling. Two miserable
apprentices, who had been won over, declared that turpitudes
were committed in the secret meetings of the Calvinists.
The Cardinal de Lorraine went straight to relate this to the
queen-mother, aggravating his recital with all the abominations
with which in former times the Gnostics, the Mersalians,
the Borborites, and the Manichæans, had been reproached, so
that the Reformers might seem to have combined, as in a
common sewer, the vices of every age.</p>

<p>Among the persons mentioned, were the wife and two
daughters of a celebrated advocate of Paris. They voluntarily
gave themselves up to justice, preferring death to dishonour.
They were confronted with the two apprentices, who
coloured, stammered, and so contradicted themselves in their
statements, that it became evident they had invented an execrable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
lie. Some indignant magistrates were for imprisoning
them instead of the outraged women. Just the contrary
happened: the calumniators were absolved, and the females
were sent back to their dungeons.</p>

<p>At the same time the Guises created other malcontents,
who made an approach to the Calvinists, whence resulted
the enterprise known by the name of the Conspiracy of
Amboise.</p>

<p>Many gentlemen had come to the court to claim compensation
for their blood spilled in the king’s service, or for
their properties, which had been despoiled in these times of
confusion and anarchy. The Cardinal de Lorraine, dreading
the presence of so many soldiers, caused a proclamation to
be published, which commanded all the petitioners, of whatever
rank, to quit the place within twenty-four hours, under
pain of death. A gibbet was even erected at the gates of
the castle, to confirm the menace. The gentlemen departed,
deeply angered at an affront, which no king of France had
ever passed upon his brave nobility.</p>

<p>The war began by pamphlets, in which the Lorraines were
accused of having usurped the rights of princes of the blood,
of keeping the crown in pupilage, although they were
foreigners, and of treading underfoot all the ancient laws
of the kingdom. “France can abide it no longer,” is the
language of one of these pamphlets, “and demands the convocation
of the States-General to reduce these affairs to
order.”</p>

<p>The malcontents soon passed from words to acts. Those
of the religion felt scruples. Could they have recourse to
force to obtain redress for their grievances? They consulted
the divines of Switzerland and Germany, who replied that
it was lawful to oppose the government usurped by the Lorraines,
provided one of the legitimate chiefs, namely, a prince
of the blood, were at their head, and the support of the States-General
were secured.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the greater number of the Reformed
refused to participate in this enterprise, in which,
says Brantôme, “<em>there was not less discontent than Huguenotism</em>.”
Coligny was not initiated into it, and those who
were concerned, had expressly reserved the person and authority
of the king. They proposed nothing more than to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
expel the Lorraines, and to replace the government of
France in the hands of French princes. Louis de Condé
was the invisible or <em>mute</em> chief of the conspiracy; La Renaudie,
who represented the political malcontents, rather
than the religious malcontents, was its visible chief.</p>

<p>Informed of the plot, through the treachery of the advocate
Des Avenelles, the Guises hastened from the town of
Blois, and shut themselves up with Francis II. in the Château
d’Amboise. The poor young king said to them, weeping:
“What have I done to my people that they thus pursue me?
I will hear their complaints, and redress them. I should
wish that, for a time, you would absent yourselves, that I
might see whether it is you or me against whom they rage.”
The Lorraines took good care not to accede to this advice;
for, once out of the court, they would have seen the whole
nobility of France rise to prevent their return.</p>

<p>In the first moments of his fear, the Cardinal de Lorraine had
sent to the Parliament an ordinance of amnesty, from which
the preachers, and those who had conspired under pretext
of religion, alone were excepted. But when he was certain
of triumph, he made his revenge an even balance against his
terror, and it was terrible. Twelve hundred of the conspirators
perished at Amboise. The public place was covered with
gallows; blood flowed in streams through the streets. No
inquiry, no form of trial, was permitted; and as there were
not executioners enough, the prisoners were thrown by hundreds,
tied hand and foot, into the waves of the Loire. This
same river was destined to engulf other victims: across the
abyss of centuries, the Cardinal Charles de Lorraine and
Carrier de Nantes may shake hands.</p>

<p>There was worse than this done in 1560. The Cardinal
reserved the chiefs for after dinner, as Regnier de la Planche
tells us, that he might afford a pastime to the ladies, whom
he perceived to be weary of their long stay in this fortress.
The queen-mother and the courtiers placed themselves at the
windows, <em>as if they were about to witness some mummery, or
jugglers show</em>. “And the Cardinal pointed out to them the
sufferers, with all the signs of a man greatly pleased, that
he might so much the more animate the prince against his
subjects.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Many of the condemned displayed wonderful firmness. A
gentleman named Villemongis, having dipped his hands in
the blood of his companions, raised them to heaven, crying:
“Lord, this is the blood of Thy children unrighteously
spilled: Thou wilt avenge it.”</p>

<p>The Baron de Castelnau, who, having been taken by the
Spaniards in the Flemish wars, had spent, like the Admiral
Coligny, the long days of his captivity in reading the Bible,
was examined in the prison of Amboise by the Guises and
the Chancellor Olivier. The latter inquired of him, mockingly,
what it was that could have made, of a soldier, so
learned a divine. “When I came to see you on my return
from Flanders,” said Castelnau, “I told you how I had
passed my time. You approved of it then, and we were
good friends. Why are we not so now? It is that, being
then disgraced and out of favour, you spoke with sincerity.
To-day, in order to please a man whom you despise, you are
a traitor to your God and your conscience.” The Cardinal
wished to come to the aid of the Chancellor, saying that it
was he who had fortified him in the faith, and he set himself
to expound a controversial thesis. Castelnau appealed to
the duke François de Guise, who answered that he understood
nothing about it. “Would to Heaven it were otherwise!”
cried the prisoner; “for I esteem you well enough to
think that if you were as enlightened as your brother, you
would follow better things.”</p>

<p>Having been condemned to death for treason: “I ought,
then,” said he, with bitterness, “to have said the Guises
were kings of France.” And bending his head to the axe,
he appealed from the injustice of man to the justice of his
Maker.</p>

<p>These barbarous executions inflamed the hatred of the
parties, and opened the door to civil war. The conspiracy
of Amboise became popular among the Reformers. Brantôme
relates, that many said, “Yesterday, we belonged
not to the conspiracy, and we would not have been of it
for all the gold in the universe; to-day, we would be so for
the smallest coin, and we say that the enterprise was good
and holy.”</p>

<p>The Lorraines, however, endeavoured to turn the affairs of
Amboise to the profit of their ambition. On the 17th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
March, the Duke de Guise had himself named lieutenant-general
of the kingdom. Francis II. promised to comply
with everything that his uncle might do, order, and execute.
This was to abdicate the throne; or, to speak more correctly,
to replace fiction by reality.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Lorraine even ventured upon re-attempting
his favourite project of establishing the Inquisition in France,
as in Spain. He had already obtained the adhesion of the
privy council, and drawn the reluctant consent of the queen-mother.
But the blow was warded off by the Chancellor
Michel de l’Hospital, who procured, in the month of May,
1560, the adoption of the edict of Romorantin, by which he
restored to the bishops the cognizance of the crime of heresy.
This edict was prodigal of the most cruel penalties; but, at
least, the foot of the inquisitor did not contaminate the soil
of France.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_XII">XII.</h3>
</div>


<p>This same year, 1560, so full of violence and blood, witnessed
a new step of the French Reformation—the establishment
of public worship. This was in the nature of things.
When towns, and nearly entire provinces, had embraced
the faith of the Reformers, secret meetings became impossible.
A whole people does not shut itself up in forests and
caverns to invoke its God. From whom, moreover, should
it hide itself? From itself? The idea is absurd.</p>

<p>Not only did necessity compel this step on the part of the
Reformers; they were also driven to it by the calumnies,
with which their secret meetings were attacked. What
better means had they of convicting their enemies of untruth,
than by assembling in the light of day, and by saying:
“Come and see?”</p>

<p>Thus the primitive Christians had come out of the Catacombs,
in spite of the edicts of the emperors, as soon as they
had become numerous. The same causes produce ever the
same effects.</p>

<p>Calvin, and other prudent men, without absolutely disapproving
of these manifestations, foresaw more clearly the
results, and gave the counsel of caution. But the popular
impulse was too strong. Nîmes, Montpellier, Aigues-Mortes,
set the example, and the public worship soon spread far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
and near through Languedoc, Dauphiny, Provence, Béarn,
Guienne, Saintonge, Poitou, and Normandy.</p>

<p>Being informed of this decision by the Count de Villars, the
Marshal de Termes, and the other governors of the provinces,
the Guises replied that the preachers should be hanged without
trial, that criminal instructions should be taken against the
Huguenots, who attended the preachings, and that “<em>the
country must be swept clean of this multitude of rabble, who lived
like the Genevese</em>.” These orders were not strictly executed,
nor could they be so. The Lorraines did not recognise the
difference of the times: what was possible against a few
thousand obscure sectarians without credit, was no longer
possible before millions of proselytes, among whom were
numbered more than half the great families of the kingdom.</p>

<p>In some places in Dauphiny, at Valence, at Montélimart,
at Romans, those of the religion appropriated the (Roman)
Catholic churches to their use; another imitation of the ancient
Christians, who had invaded the temples of Paganism. This
was also inevitable, in the places where the population had
wholly changed their doctrine. The stones of the sanctuary
belong to a religion only so long as it is believed in; if the
people give it credence no longer, those stones become its
property again, and the people reconsecrates them to its
new worship.</p>

<p>The Duke de Guise felt so much the more disappointed at
the state of affairs in Dauphiny, because he was the governor
of that province. The enterprises of the heretics were in
his eyes so many personal affronts, and he despatched one
Maugiron, who surprised the towns of Valence and Romans,
gave them up to pillage, hanged the principal inhabitants,
and decapitated two ministers, with this inscription
suspended from their necks: “<em>These are the chiefs of the
rebels.</em>” These atrocities provoked reprisals. Two gentlemen
of the religion, Montbrun and Mourans, made incursions
into Dauphiny and Provence, at the head of armed
bands, sacked the churches, maltreated the priests, who had
urged the slaughter of the Reformers, and celebrated their
worship sword in hand.</p>

<p>Such a state of things could not long exist. It was neither
peace nor war, neither the freedom of (the two) religions, nor
the absolute domination of one alone. A remedy must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
found, or the whole kingdom would be given up to complete
anarchy, and the king’s council therefore resolved to convoke
the assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau. The Guises consented
to this measure with reluctance; but, alarmed themselves
at the dangers of a situation they could no longer
direct, they yielded to the influence of the politicians, or
<i lang="fr">tiers-parti</i>, which had begun to be formed under the direction
of the Chancellor L’Hospital.</p>

<p>The 21st of August, 1560, had been fixed for the opening
of the assembly. The young king took his seat on the
throne, in the great hall of the palace of Fontainebleau,
having near him his wife, Mary of Scotland, the queen-mother,
and his brothers. Cardinals, bishops, members of
the privy council, knights of the order, masters of the requests,
the dukes of Guise and Aumale, the Constable, the
Admiral, the Chancellor, all were there, except the Bourbon
princes, who, fearing a snare, had refused to be present.</p>

<p>The Duke de Guise gave an account of the administration
of the army, the Cardinal de Lorraine of that of the
finances. But, notwithstanding the importance of these
matters, the Notables bestowed little attention upon them:
they felt that the sole great affair of the moment was the
religious question.</p>

<p>Coligny had promised the Reformers to give the signal.
On a sudden, he rose, approached the throne, made a respectful
obeisance, and presented two petitions, one to the
king, the other to the queen-mother bearing this inscription:
“<em>The supplication of those, who, in divers provinces, invoke the
name of God according to the rule of piety.</em>” All present were
astonished at such boldness; for the penalty of death hung
always over the head of the heretics. But the king, François II.,
who could not have been taught his lesson beforehand, on
this emergency graciously received the petitions, and handed
them to be read, to his secretary.</p>

<p>The faithful attested that their faith was that of the
creed of the Apostles, that they had always acted as loyal
subjects of the king, and that they had been most shamefully
calumniated by the accusation of being fautors of disturbance
and sedition. “The Gospel, which we profess, teaches
us just the contrary,” said they; “and we even do not hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to confess, that we never understood so well our duty
towards your majesty as we have understood it by means
of the holy doctrine that is preached to us.” In conclusion,
they asked permission to meet in open day, and submitted
to be treated as rebels, if they should thenceforth be
found meeting by night, or unlawfully.</p>

<p>It was remarked, that these documents were unsigned.
“It is true,” answered the Admiral; “but give us leave to
assemble, and, in one day, I will bring fifty thousand signatures
from the province of Normandy alone.” “And I,” interrupted
the Duke de Guise, in an arrogant tone, “will
find a hundred thousand who will sign the reverse with their
blood.”</p>

<p>The debates were resumed on the 23rd of August.</p>

<p>Two prelates—it is a pleasure to state it—Jean de Montluc,
bishop of Valence, and Charles de Marillac, archbishop
of Vienne, proposed means of conciliation. Both had filled
embassies in Italy, and visited the Protestant countries. It
is a memorable fact, that the bishops of France, who had
compared Rome and the Reformation, should have generally
inclined to the new ideas!</p>

<p>Jean de Montluc depicted with energy the disorders which
filled the Church. He compared the Calvinist ministers,—lettered,
diligent men, having always the name of Jesus
Christ on their lips, fearing not to die to confirm their
doctrine,—to the (Roman) Catholic priests; and at this
point he pronounced words, which deserve to find a place in
history.</p>

<p>“The bishops (I speak of the greater number) have been
idlers, having no fear of giving account to God of the flock
intrusted to their charge, and their chief care has been to
preserve their revenue, and to abuse it in foolish and scandalous
expenses; so true is this, that we have seen forty residing
in Paris, while the fire was blazing in their dioceses;
and at the same time we see bishoprics given over to children
and ignorant persons, who have neither the will, nor
the knowledge, to uphold their condition. The ministers
of this sect have not failed to show this to those, who were
willing to listen to them.</p>

<p>“The curates are ignorant, greedy, busy with everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
but their duties, and, for the most part, have procured their
benefices by illicit means. And at a time which should call
to our assistance men of learning, virtue, and strong zeal, as
many double crowns as the bankers have sent to Rome, so
many curates have they sent to us.</p>

<p>“The cardinals and the bishops have made no difficulty of
conferring benefices upon their major-domos, and, what is
more, upon their valets, cooks, barbers, and lackeys. The
common priests have by their avarice, ignorance, and dissolute
life, rendered themselves odious and despised by all the
world. Such are the charming remedies that have been used
to procure peace for the Church!”</p>

<p>Montluc suggested two means of resolving the existing
difficulties: one was to preach every day before the king, the
queen, and the lords of the court, and to replace the “<em>foolish
songs</em>” of the maids of honour by the Psalms of David; the
other, to convoke, without delay, a universal free council,
and, if the pope refused, a national council.</p>

<p>The Archbishop Marillac uttered the same complaints,
supported the advice of Montluc, and proposed to decide,
moreover, that nothing should be done in the Church for
money, seeing that it is not lawful to make merchandise
of spiritual things.</p>

<p>The next day, August 24th, it was the turn of the Admiral
Coligny to speak. He required, like the two bishops, the
convocation of a free council, either general or national, and
added that permission should be given in the meanwhile to
those of the religion to meet for the worship of God. “Give
them churches, or other edifices in each place” said he, “and
send thither people to see that nothing is done against the
authority of the king and the public tranquillity. If you
were to act in this way, the kingdom would be peaceable
directly, and the subjects content.”</p>

<p>But the Cardinal de Lorraine rejected this request without
consideration. “Is it reasonable,” he asked, “that we should
be of the opinion of these people rather than of that of
the king? And as to concede to them churches or places of
assembly, this would be to approve of their heresy, which
the king could not do without being everlastingly damned.”
The Cardinal saw no greater necessity for convoking a council,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
since all that was required was to reform the manners of the
churchmen, which could be done by general or private
admonitions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Guises, being unsupported in the meeting
at Fontainebleau, both by the Chancellor and by the Constable,
consented to the convocation of the States-General for
the following December, and announced that preparatory
steps would be taken for holding a national council.</p>

<p>Pope Pius IV. was exceedingly disturbed by the mere idea
of this council, being apprehensive of seeing either a schism
result from it, or at least the re-establishment of the Pragmatic
Sanction. He wrote to the king of France to tell him
that his crown would be in danger, and to the king of Spain
to beg him to intervene. But meeting with no satisfactory
answer, he resolved to reopen the sessions of the Council of
Trent, which had been for a long time suspended. The pontiff
of Rome preferred an assembly, the majority of which
was Italian, and under his control, to a national Council of
France, which could deliberate without him, and perhaps
against him.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that the most enlightened men of
both communions,—Montluc, Marillac, L’Hospital, Coligny,—were
of the same opinion about convoking a national council.
We must not deceive ourselves as to what was really at the
bottom of this project. It was not religious liberty, as we
understand it in our day; it was simply the hope that by
mutual concessions, (Roman) Catholicism and the Reformation
might unite upon a common ground. The principle that two
religions might not exist in one state, still held sway over
the best minds.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_XIII">XIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>In joining hands with the convocation of the States-General,
the Lorraines entertained more than one secret
thought. They flattered themselves that they should come
to a conclusion with the Bourbons, envelop the Huguenots
in the ruin of their chiefs, and win the majority in the
States by seduction or intimidation.</p>

<p>Antoine de Bourbon and the Prince de Condé were invited
to take their seats as princes of the blood royal. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
were aware that great dangers awaited them, but a refusal
would have been represented as an open rupture with the
regal authority. The opposite characters of the two princes
also concurred in inducing them to accept the invitation.
The king of Navarre was too weak to brave the crown in so
evident a manner; Louis de Condé was of too bold a nature
to expose himself to the imputation of fear. The one started
on the journey because he was not daring enough, the other,
because his daring was too great.</p>

<p>Hardly had Condé entered Orleans, before he was arrested
on a charge of high treason, and commissioners were appointed
to try him. He refused to answer, on the plea that
a prince of the blood royal could be tried only by the king
and his peers, with all the assembled houses of Parliament.
The Lorraines showed him an ordinance, by which he was
declared guilty of lese-majesty, if he, persisted in his refusal.
“We must not tolerate,” said the Duke de Guise, “the bravadoes
of this young gallant, prince though he be; we must
crush the head of heresy and rebellion at one blow.”</p>

<p>The chief of the house of Bourbon humbled himself before
the duke and the cardinal, to solicit the pardon of his
brother. They received him with lofty coldness, and had a
strict watch kept over him. All historians relate that
they conceived the project of assassinating him. As they
dared not bring him to trial, it was resolved to summon him
before Francis II., and so to induce a quarrel, by which the
king should be led to draw his sword upon him. At this
signal the courtiers were to throw themselves upon Antoine
de Bourbon, and poniard him.</p>

<p>When informed of the plan, the extent of the danger
inspired him with a degree, of courage, and he said to the
Captain Rente: “I am going to a place where my death has
been sworn. If I perish, take the shirt I now wear; carry
it to my wife, since my son is not yet old enough to take
vengeance for my death; and let her send it to the Christian
princes, who will avenge me.” He then entered the king’s
chamber, and the Cardinal de Lorraine shut the door behind
him. The king made some insulting observations to him;
but either from the timidity of youth, or from pity, he was
afraid to give the signal. “The coward! the poltroon!”
murmured Francis de Guise, who was hidden behind the door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
A king of seventeen commissioned to assassinate his uncle!
What manners! What a reign! What a court!<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The Cardinal de Lorraine had also conceived a plan for
the extermination of heretics, resembling those executed
against the Albigeois of Languedoc, or the Moors of
Spain. Would that for the honour of the human race, it
were possible to deny such detestable designs; but they are
attested by (Roman) Catholic writers, and even by the Jesuit
Maimbourg.</p>

<p>The Cardinal had therefore resolved to make all Frenchmen
sign a formula of faith drawn up by the Sorbonne in
1542; a formula which, says Jean de Serres, “<em>no man of the
religion would for a thousand livres have approved or signed</em>.”</p>

<p>The king was to present this document on Christmas-day
to all the princes, officers, and chevaliers of the court; the
queen was to present it to all the ladies of the palace; the
Chancellor to the deputies of the States-General and to the
<i lang="fr">maîtres des requêtes</i>; the chiefs of the Parliaments and of
the bailiwicks to their subordinates; the governors of the
provinces to the gentry; the curates to all the inhabitants
of their parishes; the heads of houses to their servants.
Whosoever should refuse to sign, or who should even request
time, was to be put to death on the following day; or, according
to the milder version of Maimbourg, to be despoiled of
all his goods and banished from the kingdom. Four marshals
were to scour the provinces with their troops, to assist
by force of arms in carrying out this law of extermination.
The Cardinal adding burlesque to atrocity, called this formula
of faith the rat-trap of the Huguenots.</p>

<p>Never before had those of the reformed faith in France
been reduced to such a terrible extremity: when suddenly
Francis II. was taken dangerously ill. The Cardinal de Lorraine
had public processions made in Paris for his recovery.
The young prince called upon the Virgin and the saints, saying,
with the imbecile fanaticism in which he had been tutored,
that if it pleased God to restore him to health, he would
spare neither wife, nor mother, nor sisters, nor brothers, if
they were ever so little suspected of heresy. These vows were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
fruitless. Francis II. died in his seventeenth year, after a
reign of seventeen months, on the 5th December, 1560.</p>

<p>No one cared for his burial, so much were the queen-mother,
the Bourbons, the Guises, the cardinals, and the
courtiers engrossed by their own affairs. Francis II. was
escorted to Saint Denis by an old blind bishop and two
ancient servitors of his house.</p>

<p>Before he had given up his last breath, the Lorraines had
barricaded themselves in their dwelling; and there they remained
for thirty-six hours, until they were reassured as to the
intentions of the queen-mother and of the king of Navarre.
Their governments and dignities were preserved to them,
but they were no longer masters of the state. Charles IX,
ten years and a half old, was proclaimed king, Catherine de
Medicis regent, and Anthony de Bourbon lieutenant-general
of the kingdom. He might, as first prince of the blood,
have claimed the regency; but he lost his opportunity for
want of vigour. The prince of Condé came out of prison;
the Constable Anne of Montmorency resumed his office of
grand master near the new king; and Admiral Coligny,
asking nothing for himself, endeavoured to secure the free
exercise of religion. The whole aspect of affairs was
changed. The faithful (once more) breathed.</p>

<p>The States-General opened at Orleans on the 13th December.
The Chancellor Michel de l’Hospital, the first to speak
in the name of the infant king and the regent, declared that
the disorder of the Church had given birth to heresy, and
that a good reformation alone could extinguish it. He advised
the (Roman) Catholics to <em>adorn themselves with virtues and
a good life</em>, and to attack their adversaries with the arms of
charity, of prayer, and of persuasion. “The knife” he said,
“avails but little against the mind; gentleness will do more
than severity. Give up those fiendish names—the symbols
of parties, factions, and seditions—Lutherans, Huguenots,
Papists. Let us not change the name of Christian.” He
ended by proposing the reunion of a national council for the
settlement of all religious differences.</p>

<p>The orator of the Third Estate, Jean Lange, advocate of
the Parliament of Bordeaux, keenly attacked three vices of the
(Roman) Catholic clergy—ignorance, avarice, and luxury—intimating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that troubles would cease when these abuses should
be corrected.</p>

<p>Jacques de Silly, lord of Rochefort, spoke for the nobility,
and did not spare the priests any more than did the orator
of the Third Estate. He complained of their meddling in
the administration of justice, of their enormous possessions,
of the non-residence of the bishops, of their want of zeal for
the instruction of their flocks, and finished by asking for
churches for the gentlemen of the reformed religion.</p>

<p>Some months later, at the meeting of the States at Saint
Germain, another orator of the Third Estate, the first magistrate
of Autun, went so far as to propose the alienation of the
goods of the Church, which he estimated at one hundred and
twenty millions of livres; that the king should sell these possessions,
and reserve forty-eight millions, which at an interest
of one in twelve, would yield a yearly revenue of four millions,
sufficient for the support of the priests; that then
seventy-two millions would remain, of which forty-two millions
might be employed in paying off the debts of the crown,
and the remainder might be spent in the encouragement of
agriculture and commerce. As to religious differences, the
same orator proposed to discuss them in a national council,
legalized and free, to and from which, safe access and return
should be guaranteed.</p>

<p>We are astonished at finding, in 1560, thoughts which were
not fulfilled till 1789. It was the great voice of the people
which was (then) heard. Civil wars had not yet fanaticised
their minds and rendered their hearts inaccessible to pity.
It was one of those short moments when the Reformation
might have obtained the ascendant in France. Three-fourths
of the nobility was gained over; the <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> was
prepared; the magistracy was waiting; and would not the
lower orders, already favourable to the new ideas in one part
of the kingdom, have communicated an impulse to the
other? What then was it that arrested this vast movement,
whence a new France, a new Europe, might have
sprung? First let us look to the Almighty, whose ways are
wrapt in mystery. But in looking to men, what do we find?
Among many, no doubt, sincere convictions, the weight of
ancient traditions, respect for old recollections and customs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Let us not attribute to selfish motives the great events of
mankind; but we must not omit to point out the tortuous
policy of Catherine de Medicis, the ambition of the Guises,
the intrigues of the king of Spain, the designs and the
cupidity of the clergy.</p>

<p>The position of the priests at the States-General of Orleans
was a difficult one, and the more they felt their weakness,
the greater was the violence they displayed. The orator
they had chosen, Jean Quintin, professor of Canon Law, began
by regretting that the nobility and the Third Estate had
thought proper to speak on their own behalf, when the
States-General formed a body, of which the king was the
head, and of which <em>the Church was the mouth</em>. He accused
the heretics of having no other Gospel than that of destroying
altars, of evading ecclesiastical obedience, and of overthrowing
the civil laws. Upon the strength of this, he invited
his majesty to persecute them to the uttermost, as the
sword was in his hand for no other purpose. He added,
that since they were excommunicated, it was unlawful to
dwell with them, to converse with them, to deal with them;
but it was lawful to beat them, and to put them to death,
for fear of sharing in their sin.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, in conclusion, “all the clergy of your
kingdom, on their bended knees, body and heart, humbly prostrate
before your majesty, beseech you to be their protector
and defender. They pray that if any excavator of dead
and buried heresies should take upon him to revive a sect
already condemned, and should to this end present a request,
and demand churches and leave to inhabit the kingdom (here
all eyes were turned upon Coligny, who sat opposite to the
orator), we supplicate that he be held and declared a heretic,
and proceeded against with all the rigour of the law, canon
and civil, in order that the wicked wretch be driven from
amongst us.”</p>

<p>Although not unaccustomed to the declamations and
invectives of the priests, this harangue, prompted by a
savage fanaticism, astonished the States-General. The admiral
demanded satisfaction from the queen-mother for the insult
to himself, and Jean Quintin was compelled to offer him an
apology. “A few days after,” says Jean de Serres, “he died
of mortification, on finding himself exposed by several published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
replies to his harangue, in which his calumnies and
falsehoods were clearly refuted.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BI_XIV">XIV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The States-General had served the cause of the Reformation.
The Cardinal de Lorraine, annoyed at having played
only a secondary part, withdrew to his archbishopric at
Rheims. The Duke de Guise retired from the court; and
the queen-mother, seeing that the two orders of the laity disapproved
of religious persecutions, manifested, in concert
with the Chancellor L’Hospital, a favourable disposition
towards the Calvinists.</p>

<p>Coligny caused the reformed faith to be preached in his
apartments, and Catherine de Medicis opened the pulpit of
the palace of Fontainebleau to the bishop Montluc, the
same who had so forcibly exclaimed against the abuses
of the Roman church in the assembly of Notables. The
courtiers, ever ready to range themselves on the side of
fortune and power, flocked around the new preachers, and left
a Jacobin monk to preach the Lent sermon to himself.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the Jesuit Maimbourg bitterly of
the queen-mother, “that, on the most favourable construction,
it may be fearlessly said, that if all she did upon this
occasion was but a pretence, she did ill to feign so well as to
give ground to believe that she belonged to the new sect.
For she not only allowed the ministers to preach in the
apartments of the prince, where all the world crowded to
hear him, whilst a poor Jacobin, who preached the Lent sermon
at Fontainebleau, was deserted; but she went so far as
to take part herself with all her ladies at the sermons of the
bishop of Valence, who preached openly, in one of the rooms
of the château, the new dogmas he had drawn from the
heresies of Luther and Calvin. So sudden and so strange a
change took place at court, that one would have said she
was quite a Calvinist. Although it was Lent, meat was
publicly sold, and spread upon every table. They talked no
more of attending Mass, and the young king, who was still
taken there to keep up appearances, went almost alone.
They scoffed at the authority of the Popes, at the worship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of the saints and of images, at indulgences, and at the ceremonies
of the Church, which they treated as superstitions.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>If the Jesuit was right in saying that the queen-mother’s
going to the sermon was only a feint, he might have added,
that it was also a feint on her part when she went to Mass.
Sceptical, as for the most part were the upper classes of Italy
in her time, Catherine de Medicis still perhaps believed in
magic and sorcery, although not in Christian truth. Instead
of serving God, she turned God to her service.</p>

<p>At any rate, the impulse spread to the provinces. How
was it possible to interdict the public gatherings of the
religious, when they could point to the example of the court?
The timid grew bold, temporizers made up their minds.
The enthusiasm was general. Controversial writings inundated
the land. We possess an ample collection, under the
titles of “Apologetic Complaint of the Churches,” “Christian
Exhortation to the King of France,” “Remonstrances
to the Queen and to the King of Navarre,” and many others
of a similar kind.</p>

<p>In these days of fervour and of hope, the faithful believed
that the triumph of the Reformation was completely in the
hands of the leaders of the state. “It rests with you alone,”
they wrote to Catherine de Medicis and Antoine de Bourbon,
“that Jesus Christ be known and worshipped throughout
the kingdom, in all truth, righteousness, and holiness. For if
you ordain that all superstitions and idolatries be extirpated,
it will be done without let or hindrance. A single word
from your lips will banish all those, who have been guilty of
malversation in the Church. This single word will deprive
them of strength, virtue, and power.”</p>

<p>There were now not pastors enough. Switzerland was
written to for more. Geneva, the Pays de Vaud, the canton of
Neufchâtel, supplied as many as they could. They even
deprived themselves of those, whose services were most
useful to them, in order to satisfy wants more pressing than
their own. Many young men, instructed under the eye of
Calvin, and others of mature age, of different professions,
were consecrated to the ministry of the Gospel. All saw,
in the ardour of their faith, a great nation to be conquered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>On their side, the priests, it may easily be believed, were
not asleep; and as they found no support at court, they
turned their attention to the people. Disturbances arose at
several towns,—at Pontoise, at Amiens, and particularly at
Beauvais. The Cardinal Odet de Châtillon, who was accused
of having celebrated the communion of the Lord’s Supper,
on Easter-day, 1561, after the fashion of Geneva, was
assailed by the populace, and Marshal de Montmorency had
to come from Paris, with a numerous escort, to quell the
sedition.</p>

<p>L’Hospital sent to the bailiffs and seneschals letters patent
commanding them to liberate all prisoners on account of
religion, and not again to visit the interiors of houses under
the pretext of illicit meetings. But the Parliament of Paris,
angry that the letters had been despatched before they had
been registered, and ill disposed to the Reformation, since,
by a stroke of authority, Anne Dubourg and six or seven
other counsellors had been removed, demanded that the preexisting
statutes should be rigidly observed.</p>

<p>But this opposition would have been impotent, had not
another arisen out of it, under the name of the triumvirate.
This was composed of the Duke de Guise, of the Constable
de Montmorency, and of the Marshal de Saint André. Behind
this association was the Cardinal de Lorraine with the
mass of the clergy; above them, the pope and Philip II.;
beneath them the people, especially those of the north and
west. The triumvirate, which succeeded in winning over
even the king of Navarre, was the most serious obstacle to
the progress of the Reformation in France: it is essential,
therefore, to explain its origin and character.</p>

<p>The Duke de Guise, kept at a distance by Catherine de
Medicis, and hated by the princes of the blood, could not by
himself recover the authority, of which the death of Francis II.
had deprived him. He, therefore, sought assistance abroad,
and formed a close alliance with the Spanish ambassador,
who had received from Philip II. instructions to keep up
troubles in the kingdom, in order to weaken it, and hand it
over to his mercy. This ambassador, as is correctly observed
by the Abbé d’Anquetil, acted the part of a French minister
of state; he gave his advice in all matters of business,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
praised, blamed, and corrected; whilst the Guises in all things
were with him.</p>

<p>The support of Spain, however, would not have sufficed for
the Lorraines. An abandoned woman, the former favourite
of Henry II., Diana of Poitiers, who feared lest the spoils
of the Huguenots should be demanded back from her, undertook
to reconcile the old constable with the Duke de
Guise.</p>

<p>Anne de Montmorency was at that time sixty-four years
old. This companion in arms of Francis I., who had made
him constable in 1538, was a brave cavalier, a loyal servant
of the crown, and able to bear disgrace with courage; but of
a narrow mind, rough in character, mistaking obstinacy for
strength, and rudeness for dignity. In religion he only knew
that he was the first Christian baron, and that the kings, his
masters, were (Roman) Catholics. He concluded that he was
bound to give no quarter to heresy.</p>

<p>Brantôme tells us what was the singular piety of Anne de
Montmorency. He fasted with punctilious regularity on
Friday, and failed not to repeat his <i lang="la">pater-noster</i> morning and
evening; but sometimes he broke off, saying, “Go and
hang me such a one; hang up this one to a tree; set fire to
everything for a mile round.” And then he would continue
his devotions, as if nothing were the matter.</p>

<p>His hands were not quite clean in his conduct of the
financial affairs under Henry II., and when he learned that
the States-General were going to call upon him for his
accounts, he conceived that it was an intrigue of the Bourbons,
who had a design against his honour, as well as his
purse. From that moment he kept aloof from them.</p>

<p>In vain did his eldest son, the Marshal de Montmorency,
esteemed, says Mézeray, as <em>one of the wisest nobles of the kingdom</em>,
represent to him that he could not, and ought not to separate
himself from the princes of the blood, and from his nephews
the Châtillons, to become the tool of the house of Lorraine;
the obstinate constable always replied: “I am a good servant
of the king and of my little masters (so he called the
young brothers of Charles IX.), and for the honour of his
majesty, I will not suffer the actions of the dead king to be
impeached.”</p>

<p>The wife of the constable, Madeline of Savoy, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
<em>was usually surrounded by priests and monks</em>, according to the
history of Jean de Serres, <em>inflamed him by her outcries</em>. She
pandered to his vanity as first Christian baron. “As the
first officer of the crown,” she said to him, “and descended
not only from the first baron, but from the first Christian of
France, you are bound not to suffer the diminution of the
Roman church: the ancient device of the house of De
Montmorency is, ‘<i lang="fr">Dieu aide au premier Chrétien!</i>’”</p>

<p>Diana of Poitiers, Madeline of Savoy, the Lorraines, the
priests, and the ambassador of Philip II., managed so well, that
the Duke de Guise and Anne de Montmorency took counsel
together on Easter-day. The skilful contrivers of the affair
took care to forget the conscience of the old man.</p>

<p>The third member of the triumvirate was Jacques d’Albon,
Marshal de Saint André. Notwithstanding his great military
command, he had no strength by himself, and sought
for allies to acquire a position. He was an epicurean, who
had wasted the goods confiscated from the Huguenots.
Brantôme, so indulgent towards the vices of courtiers, says
of him: “He was always given to consult his ease, to pleasures,
and to excessive luxuries of the table. He was
the first to introduce them at court, and truly they surpassed
all bounds. He was a very Lucullus in ostentation and
magnificence.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>These were the authors of the triumvirate, and the pretended
friends of the (Roman) Catholic religion. Worldly
motives united them; religion was only their pretext.</p>

<p>The Guises had gathered confidence and courage. This
clearly appeared in the language held by the Cardinal de
Lorraine after the consecration of Charles IX., in the month
of May, 1561. He uttered grave complaints of the meetings
of the Huguenots, which went on growing, and he demanded
that a new edict should be discussed and drawn up in full
Parliament, before the princes, the lords, and all the members
of the privy council.</p>

<p>The sittings lasted twenty days. An order resulted,
which, while giving an amnesty for the faults committed on
either side, and inviting the priests no longer to excite the
people, forbade the public meetings of the religion until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
reunion of a national council, under pain of confiscation
and banishment. This order, which was only adopted by
a majority of three voices, bore the name of the Edict of
July.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic party congratulated itself upon
having obtained a great victory, and the Duke de Guise said,
on coming out of the court of the Parliament: “To maintain
this edict, my sword shall never be sheathed.” But was it
not madness to hope that men, who for forty years had
braved the scaffold and the stake, would hesitate before the
pain of banishment? What followed will show; France had
yet to go through many terrible catastrophes before the two
parties were disposed to make peace on more equitable conditions.</p>

</div>


<p>All the recent statutes upon matters of religion were
only provisional. They announced the approaching reunion
of a council, which was to close the controversies definitively;
and this was soon a general cry throughout France.</p>

<p>The idea was not new. From the moment of the Reformation,
Germany had demanded the convocation of an Œcumenical
and altogether free council. The popes had long
refused; they remembered the great gatherings of Constance
and Bâle, and feared to find themselves face to face with
these States-General of the Church. Overcome at last by
the urgent demands of the princes and people, they had
chosen an Italian town for the place of meeting; they had
filled the council with their creatures; and had suspended
or reopened the sessions, now at one point, now at another,
according to the calculations of their policy. Protestants
could not recognise this vain semblance of an universal council,
and they kept away. The enlightened (Roman) Catholics of
France were themselves offended, and it was determined to
have a national council.</p>

<p>Most of the French cardinals and bishops were opposed
to this. “To what purpose is it, to dispute with such obstinate
people,” said the old Cardinal de Tournon; “if they wish
to show their means of defence, let them go to the council of
Trent; they will have safe conduct, and they may justify
themselves if they can.” However, the Cardinal de Lorraine,
who was better acquainted with the temper of the court,
and counted a good deal upon his eloquence to overthrow
the Huguenots, as the writers on their side reproach him,
was of a different opinion. He proposed to authorize, not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
council, but a simple theological conference, and he obtained
the consent of the chiefs of the clergy by the help of this
compromise.</p>

<p>The whole affair, however, was full of equivocations and
misunderstandings, and that is enough to make us understand
the character and issue of the conference of Poissy.</p>

<p>The Reformed pastors, remembering what had happened
at Zurich, at Geneva, and other places of Switzerland and
Germany, wished to treat with the priests as equals, taking
the Bible as the supreme arbiter of the controversy, and
giving to the chiefs of the state the right to decide finally
between the two parties.</p>

<p>The cardinals and bishops meant quite otherwise. [They
would admit] no equality. They held themselves to be the
only true representatives of the Church, and looked upon the
doctors of the Reformation as men who had gone astray, and
whom they listened to out of pure condescension. They did
not accept the Bible as the sole arbiter of the debate. In
fact, they reserved to themselves the right of being judges in
their own cause, and of themselves deciding what should be
admitted or condemned.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic clergy, in one sense, were in the right,
because it does not belong to the civil power to resolve religious
questions; but in another sense, they were altogether wrong,
for in consenting to discuss these matters before the depositaries
of political authority, they appeared to give up
that, which in reality they would not concede. The conference
of Poissy then could only be a simple theological
passage of arms, or rather, as it afterwards turned out, an
empty mockery. The priests were sure, whatever happened,
to win their cause, since they reserved to themselves the right
of bringing it to a close.</p>

<p>The pastors, convoked to the number of twelve, came
accompanied by twenty-two lay deputies. The most eminent
amongst them was Theodore de Bèze; he came to fill the
place of Calvin, for whom the magistrates of Geneva had in
vain demanded hostages of high rank.</p>

<p>Theodore de Bèze was born, in 1519, at Vézelay, a little
town of Burgundy, of a noble family. He had been confided
to the care of the celebrated professor Melchior Wolmar,
who made him read the Scriptures, and by his example,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
as much as by his lessons, planted in his heart the first
seeds of piety. Thirty years later, Bèze testified his gratitude
to his instructor, and greeted him as his father, when he
sent him his confession of faith.</p>

<p>These pious instructions at first appeared to have been
stifled beneath the passions of youth. Surrounded in Paris
by all that could lead him astray, amiable, rich, and witty, he
lived as a man of the world, published a volume of light poetry
under the name of <cite>Juvenilia</cite>, and contracted a secret marriage.
He kept it secret, because one of his uncles, who was
in orders, had made over to him the revenues of some ecclesiastical
benefices.</p>

<p>A serious illness awakened his conscience. “As soon as
I had strength to raise myself,” he writes to Wolmar, “I
broke all my chains, packed up my travelling effects, and left
my country, my parents, my friends, to follow Christ. I
went into voluntary exile, and retired to Geneva with my
wife.” He caused his marriage to be sanctioned by the
Church, and condemned all the errors of his youth. This
was in the month of November, 1548; he was then twenty-nine
years and four months old.</p>

<p>The Jesuits Garasse and Maimbourg, and, which more
astonishes us, the Cardinal de Richelieu, have seized upon the
poems of a student of twenty, to attack the austere Memoirs
of the Reformer. Could they not understand the sacred
duties of repentance?</p>

<p>Become poor, since he had given up all to his convictions,
Theodore de Bèze, the man who had been the ornament of
the saloons of Paris, determined to make himself a printer,
joining with him Jean Crispin, the author of the <cite>History of
the Martyrs</cite>. But if he had humility enough to accept this
position, he had too much merit to remain in it. He was
made professor of theology, rector of the Academy, and pastor
at Geneva.</p>

<p>Then he contracted intimate relations with Calvin. Both
lived in the same faith, and in the same hope; both brought
the same zeal to the propagation <ins class="corr" id="tn-103" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of the doctines'">
of the doctrines</ins> of the Reformation
in France. Calvin was gifted with a broader and
more masculine genius, a severer logic, a more penetrating
vision, a science more profound, and a stronger will. He was
the genius and the master of Theodore de Bèze. But Bèze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
had an easier and more flowing eloquence, and more amiable
manners, which were better suited to the relations of social
life. The one was more fitted to stir up and govern men,
the other to negotiate with them. It has been said that
Bèze was the Melancthon of the new Luther. There is
truth in the comparison. But the Reformer of Germany
seems to have needed Melancthon more than the Reformer
of Geneva required Theodore de Bèze. Melancthon was
the counsellor, the support of Luther, and finished his work;
Bèze was but the most illustrious of the disciples of Calvin.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to see with what modesty he placed himself
beneath Calvin, listening with deference, and seeking no other
glory, if indeed he sought any, than that of reproducing the
image of his master. “He attached himself so strongly to
Calvin,” says his biographer, Antoine de la Faye, “that he
scarcely ever left him. The conversation of this great man
was of such advantage to him, that he made incredible progress,
both in the doctrine and in the knowledge of ecclesiastical
discipline.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>He composed many works, of which the greater part
have a polemical character. His most considerable works
are Commentaries upon the New Testament, collections of
sermons, the translation into French verse of a part of the
Psalms, and the History of the Reformed Churches of
France up to the year 1562.</p>

<p>Bèze went to preach at Nérac and Béarn in 1560, on
the invitation of the king of Navarre. He had scarcely
returned to Geneva, before he was summoned to the conference
of Poissy, being esteemed, next to Calvin, as the most
capable of upholding the cause of the Reformation in that
assembly. “He was,” says his biographer, “of ordinary
height, he had a handsome face, an agreeable bearing....
God had given him an understanding above the vulgar, an
exquisite judgment, a marvellous memory, a rare eloquence,
and an affability so engaging that he won the hearts of all
who saw him.”</p>

<p>From the moment of his arrival at Poissy, he preached
publicly at the court, before an attentive and select assembly.
This was on the 24th of August, 1561. Eleven years later,
to the very day, Charles IX. and Catherine de Medicis caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the tocsin of the [massacre of] Saint Bartholomew to knell.
The inconstancy of human things! O profound mysteries of
the future!</p>

<p>The same evening, meeting the Cardinal de Lorraine in
the apartments of the king of Navarre, they held a conversation
upon the articles of doctrine, and especially upon
the Communion. The cardinal appeared to hold little to
the dogma of transubstantiation, provided that the real presence
could be in someway maintained, and after having
listened to Bèze to the end, said to him: “I am glad to
have seen and heard you, and I beseech you, in God’s name,
to confer with me, that I may hear your reasons, and you
mine, and you will find that I am not so black as I am
represented.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Madame de Crussol, who was <em>free-spoken</em>, cried:
“You are a good man to-day, but what will you be to-morrow?
Bring ink and paper, and make the cardinal sign what
he has said and confessed; for he will soon say the reverse.”
She had guessed right. The rumour went, the day after, that
at the very first blow the cardinal had closed the mouth of
the professor of Geneva. The constable expressed his joy
to the queen at dinner. “I was there,” coldly replied Catherine
de Medicis, “and I can assure you that you are
not rightly informed.”</p>

<p>The pastors presented requests, in which they demanded
that the bishops should not be their judges, since they were
hostile parties; that the conference should be presided over
by the king and the great persons of the state; that all the
differences should be decided solely by the Word of God, and
that secretaries, equal in number on either side, should draw
up minutes of the proceedings, which should not be held to
be authentic until they were approved and signed. This was
putting the finger upon the knot of the question; but the
bishops would have broken up twenty conferences rather
than consent to such arrangements. The queen-mother
knew this well; she gave an indefinite answer, or she
invited the pastors to content themselves with her simple
word, that the prelates should not be the judges of the discussion;
but she refused to promise anything in writing.</p>

<p>On the eve of the conference, twelve doctors of the Sorbonne
arrived at Saint Germain, with a sorrowful air, and entreated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Catherine not to let the heretics speak, or at least only to
grant them this favour with closed doors. “The (conference)
will bring no edification,” they said; “and the king is so
young, that he may be infected by this doctrine.” “I have
engaged myself for good reasons,” answered the queen, “and
cannot go back; but be quiet, all will go well!”</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_II">II.</h3>
</div>


<p>The conference of Poissy opened on the 9th of September,
1561. This was the great spectacle of the moment for Christianity.
The pope trembled lest he should lose the finest of his
provinces, and had sent in haste the cardinal of Ferrara with
the general of the Jesuits, to hinder its taking place. The
king of Spain, partly from policy, partly from fanaticism,
feared the reconciliation of the two religions in France. The
(Roman) Catholic and the Protestant states awaited with
equal impatience the issue of the debate.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, they met in the refectory of the
nuns of Poissy. The king Charles IX., a child of eleven
years, seated himself on his throne, having on his right and
left the princes and princesses of his family, the chevaliers
of the order, and the officers and ladies of the court. On
the two lateral sides of the oblong apartment, were the
cardinals de Tournon, de Lorraine, de Châtillon, de Bourbon,
de Guise, and d’Armagnac; below them a crowd of bishops
and doctors. The deputies of the Reformed Churches had not
yet been introduced. This [was the] first mark of inequality.</p>

<p>The young king rose, and recited a discourse, in which
he exhorted those present to divest themselves of all passion,
and to discuss only for the honour of God, the discharge of
their own conscience, and the re-establishment of the peace
of the kingdom. The Chancellor Michel de l’Hospital, was
the next to speak. “You are assembled,” he said, “to proceed
to the reformation of manners and doctrine. It is not
expedient to wait for a general council, because several
princes decline to send representatives, others will have none
of it, and it will be composed chiefly of strangers, who are
ignorant of our affairs. As to what is said, that we ought
not to hold two councils at the same time, this is not the
first time that such has been the case. The best way to
arrive at an understanding, is to proceed with humility, laying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
aside subtle and curious disputes. There is no occasion for
many books, but to thoroughly understand the Word of God,
and to conform to that as closely as possible. Do not esteem
them enemies, who are said to be of the new religion, who are
Christians, and baptized like yourselves, and do not condemn
them through prejudice. Receive them as a father receives
his children.”</p>

<p>The prelates were out of temper at this discourse. The
idea of a reformation in <em>doctrine</em>, and the advice to take the
Word of God for their standard, seemed to be to yield to
the demands of the Reformed. The Cardinal de Tournon
called for a copy of the chancellor’s speech, in order to
deliberate with his colleagues, because it contained, he said,
several matters of great consequence, which had not been
mentioned in the letters of convocation. The conference was
threatened to be broken up before the proceedings had been
commenced, but L’Hospital refused, and they went on.</p>

<p>At last Theodore de Bèze was introduced by the Duke de
Guise, with ten other pastors (Pierre Martyr had not yet
arrived), and twenty-two lay deputies. Their sober and
simple costume formed a strange contrast to the insignia of
the prelates and of the people of the court. Nevertheless,
they presented themselves with confidence; for they knew
that they had God above them, and behind them a great
part of the nation.</p>

<p>They offered to pass the balustrade, and to seat themselves
by the side of the (Roman) Catholic doctors. They were
stopped—a fresh mark of inequality. It pleased the priests
that the disciples of the Reformation should be detained at
the bar, like persons accused. With uncovered heads they
bowed respectfully, and Theodore de Bèze, kneeling with the
pastors, made a solemn confession of the sins of the people,
and implored the benediction of Heaven upon the assembly.
He was listened do with emotion and astonishment.</p>

<p>Having thanked the king for the favour which he had
accorded to the Reformed, of being enabled to justify themselves
before him, Bèze addressed himself to the prelates, and
supplicated them, in the name of the great God, who would
be Judge of all, to unite with him, not in giving way to sterile
discussions, but to discover truth. He would not attack what
he knew to be eternal,—the true Church of the Lord. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
promised to correct himself, and his brethren, if any error
should be found in them. “And would to God,” cried he,
“that without going further, instead of opposing arguments,
we might all sing a canticle with one voice, and hold out our
hands to one another.”</p>

<p>Then Bèze unfolded the leading doctrines of the Reformation;
and upon points of discipline, declared, among other
things, that the Reformed professed to obey their kings and
superiors, with this only reservation, that their first obedience
was due to God, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.
Having finished his discourse, he again knelt down with his
brethren, and presented to Charles IX. the confession of
faith of the French churches.</p>

<p>A deep silence had reigned throughout the assembly up
to the passage when he said, in speaking of the sacrament
of the communion, “If any one asks us if we hold Jesus
Christ to be absent from the Holy Supper, we answer, no.
But if we look to the distance between places, as we must
do, when the question of His corporal presence and his manhood
is distinctly considered, we say that His body is as far
removed from the bread and the wine, as the high heaven is
distant from the earth....”</p>

<p>At these words, deep murmurs broke out in the ranks
of the bishops. Some exclaimed: “<em>He has blasphemed!</em>”
Others rose, and would have left. The Cardinal de Tournon
however, interrupted the speaker, and prayed the king
to impose silence upon him, or to permit them to retire.
But the king, the queen, the princes, remained quietly in
their places, and Bèze was enabled to explain his thoughts,
which amounted to this: that on the one hand, the body of
Jesus Christ is in heaven, and not elsewhere; that on the
other hand, the faithful are made the recipients of His body
and of His blood by faith, after a spiritual manner.</p>

<p>He had hardly done speaking, when the Cardinal de
Tournon, trembling and stammering with rage, said to the
king: “We thought rightly that these new evangelists
might utter things unfit for the ear of a most Christian king.
But we beseech you to give no heed, and to withhold your
judgment until an answer has been made. We hope that
you will be brought back....” (but immediately correcting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
himself), “not brought back, but preserved in the true
path.”</p>

<p>It is well to consult the discussion, which arose, more than
a century later, upon this singular incident, between Bossuet,
Basnage, and Bayle. That the Cardinal de Tournon,
the dean of the French cardinals, an old man of seventy-two,
should be carried away, may be excused from his great
age. But how explain the clamours of the other chiefs of the
clergy? Bèze had only reproduced, in measured terms, the
doctrine of the Reformed upon the Eucharist. The prelates
must have known it; they must also have foreseen that
Bèze would maintain it. What, then, was the meaning of
this sudden anger? Either it was feigned, or it was insane.
Did they only seek a pretext to break up the conference?
Admitting, even, that the bishops saw in their adversaries
only accused men, still an accused man has, at least, the
right to set forth his convictions, and to interrupt him
by the cry of blasphemy, was the most flagrant of contradictions.</p>

<p>After the sitting, the prelates held council with their
theologians, to determine what they should do. “Would to
God,” the Cardinal de Lorraine said to them, “he had been
dumb, or we deaf!” Their embarrassment was extreme;
but it was necessary to answer, not again by supplications,
but by reasons. They agreed to confine themselves to the
justification of the two points of the Church and of the
Supper; and Claude d’Espence, the most learned of their
doctors, was instructed to prepare the materials of the discourse,
which the Cardinal de Lorraine was to deliver.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the bishops resolved to draw up a confession
of faith, which all should sign, and which they should
afterwards present for the signature of the pastors. If
they should refuse, an anathema was to be instantly fulminated
against them, and the discussion to be closed. It was
thus that the Roman clergy pretended to confer with their
adversaries! It is but right to say that some (Roman) Catholic
theologians had the candour to oppose the resolutions of the
majority.</p>

<p>The deputies of the churches, informed of this, complained
to the king, saying that it was contrary to every law, human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and divine, if even the bishops were to be their judges, to
condemn them unheard. “We declare,” added they, “that
if, in consequence of having heard us, disturbances cannot
be allayed, or that greater should, to our regret, arise, we are
guiltless of them, because we have sought and followed every
means of concord.” The chancellor promised them justice,
and compelled the bishops to desist.</p>

<p>On the 16th of September, in the same refectory of
Poissy, and before the same assembly, the Cardinal de Lorraine
delivered his discourse upon the two articles agreed
upon. He declared that the Church could not err, and that
if a part should fall into error, they ought to have recourse
to the throne of Rome, admitted from ancient times to be the
first of Christendom. As to the Holy Supper, he insisted
upon the real presence, and deplored that what had been given
us as a means of union, should have become a subject of
discord. Finally, he addressed a pathetic appeal to the king,
beseeching him to remain in the religion his ancestors had
handed down to him from the time of Clovis.</p>

<p>Theodore de Bèze asked leave to reply upon the spot;
but the prelates had already risen in confusion, and the
Cardinal de Tournon said to the king: “If those, who have
separated, are willing to subscribe to what has been said by
Monsieur de Lorraine, they shall be heard at greater length
upon the other points. If not, let all hearing be denied
them; let your majesty send them back, and purge your
kingdom of them! This is what the assembly of prelates
humbly asks of you, in order that in this most Christian
kingdom there may be but one faith, one law, and one king.”</p>

<p>The doctors of the Reformation then understood what a
wretched mockery was meant by the prelates in this conference
of Poissy. No free debate, not even the show of
deliberation, not even the patience of a tribunal, which
hears the accused to the end, [was to be permitted to them].
An unconditional, absolute adhesion upon the two points of
the Church and the Supper, which logically included all the
other points, [must be given]; if not, anathema and exile
[were to be their lot].</p>

<p>They again made bitter, but useless complaints. To say
the truth, from this moment there was no longer a conference;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and the cardinal of Ferrara, who arrived at this
juncture, confirmed the clergy in their resolutions, by saying
that the pope had learned with extreme displeasure of the
holding of this kind of national council. Nothing further
took place than some private discussions, in the presence of
persons carefully selected; and the lay deputies could not even
obtain permission to attend.</p>

<p>On the 24th of September, in the little priory-chamber of
Poissy, Theodore de Bèze discussed the two contested articles
with the Cardinal de Lorraine, the doctor Claude d’Espence,
and a certain Claude de Saintes, a <em>little white monk</em>, half-theologian,
half-clown, who treated his adversary as an Anabaptist
for having said he had received the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Lorraine had prepared a surprise, from
which he expected great results—to make the Lutheran
doctors dispute against the Calvinists. From the commencement
of the conference, he had written to the governor of
Metz to send him some theologians of the Confession of
Augsburg, learned, and above all, very obstinate, in their
opinions. The theologians came; but one of them having
died of the plague on arriving at Paris, they were afraid
to summon the others immediately to the court.</p>

<p>But the cardinal was unwilling to lose all the fruit of his
ingenious contrivance; so drawing from his breast a paper,
which he had received from the Counts Palatine, he called upon
the ministers to declare, yes or no, if they would sign the
three or four principal articles. They asked time to reflect.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September they went before the queen,
who had near her the chiefs of the clergy, and said they
desired to know if the Cardinal de Lorraine and the other
prelates, renouncing the dogma of transubstantiation, would
themselves attach their signature to the extract of the Confession
of Augsburg. “If it is wished that we should sign
something,” continued Theodore de Bèze, “it is reasonable
that the Cardinal de Lorraine should also sign what he presents
to us in the name of his party.”</p>

<p>The cardinal was excessively nettled at this proposition.
“We are not equal, and far from being so,” he said. “For
my part, I am not called upon to sign on the word of any
master; I subscribe neither to those, who made this confession,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
nor to you.” “Since you will not,” answered Bèze, “sign
yourselves, it is not just to call upon us to do so.” Bossuet
pretends that Theodore de Bèze only escaped by a subtlety.
It may be so; but his antagonist had set him the example.</p>

<p>Jacques Lainez, the general of the Jesuits, who had just
arrived with the legate, assisted at this conference. He delivered
so ridiculous and insolent a discourse in Italian, that it
astonished even the most impetuous (Roman) Catholics. After
comparing the heretics to foxes and wolves, he said they
ought not to discuss with them, but to send them before the
Council of Trent, and that it did not belong to laymen or to
women to judge of these matters. This last arrow hit
Catherine de Medicis, who showed how deeply it offended her.</p>

<p>Passing to the question of the Supper, the general of the
Jesuits wished to explain it by saying that Jesus Christ is
present in the Sacrament, as a king who played his own part
in the feasts celebrated to his honour. He dwelt at length
upon this comparison, heaving deep sighs, and at the end of
his discourse he wept. Bèze scornfully replied that “he had
made a farce of the Supper, in which Jesus Christ was the
harlequin, a remark foolish and unworthy to be spoken, or
heard.” Then quitting the Jesuit, he entered upon a more
serious debate with Claude d’Espence.</p>

<p>Such was the first appearance of the Jesuits in France:
but it scarcely indicated the important part they were to
play in after-times. It was the prelates, assembled at Poissy,
who authorized them to establish themselves in France; so
that, according to the judicious remark of an historian, the
assembly from which an equitable arrangement was expected
between the religions, only served to introduce those into the
kingdom, who stopped at nothing to prevent it.</p>

<p>The conference was reduced to still narrower limits. The
queen-mother charged certain theologians on either side to
draw up a common formulary upon the doctrine of the Supper.
The five (Roman) Catholic delegates, who had been chosen from
amongst the more moderate, succeeded in agreeing with the
Reformed by the assistance of those vague expressions, which
every one can interpret as he pleases. The news having
spread at court, many rejoiced, and Catherine de Medicis
sent for Theodore de Bèze to express to him her satisfaction.
The Cardinal de Lorraine, after reading the formula, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
contented. But the assembly of the clergy and the doctors
of the Sorbonne protested that this document was insufficient,
captious, erroneous, and heretical; and, to put it aside, they
presented to the queen a confession drawn up in the most
strictly (Roman) Catholic sense, demanding that the ministers,
if they refused to sign it, should be pronounced obstinate,
separated from the Church, and driven out of the most Christian
kingdom.</p>

<p>After this there was nothing more to be discussed, and the
conference terminated on the 9th of October. One thing
alone was made clear:—that the hope of bringing the two
communions together by mutual concessions was illusory, and
that nothing remained but either to let one exterminate the
other, or to allow them to live side by side. This last idea,
so little understood at that time, began to dawn upon a few
superior intellects, and especially in that of the Chancellor
l’Hospital, as we shall presently see.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_III">III.</h3>
</div>


<p>Notwithstanding the unhappy issue of the conference of
Poissy, the courage of the Reformed party rose greatly,
because they had had the advantage of setting forth their
faith before the chiefs of the kingdom and the princes of the
Roman (Catholic) Church. It was no longer possible to
accuse them of infamous crimes, or to give them up without
form of law to the sword of the executioner. The timid
and the undecided flew to the standard of the Reformation,
and a movement, like those we have already described on
other occasions, was once more seen.</p>

<p>Some important towns, Milhau, Sainte Foy, Lacaune, and
hundreds of villages cut themselves off at one stroke from
(Roman) Catholicism. One pastor named Beaulieu announced
to Farel that three hundred parishes of L’Agenois
had <em>put down the mass</em>. “I have heard persons worthy of
belief say,” he wrote, “that if there could be found on this
very day four thousand, or even six thousand ministers of the
Lord, they would all be employed.” Admitting that there
is some exaggeration in this, the progress would still have
been considerable.</p>

<p>The aged Farel returned for some time to his native
country, and passing by Grenoble, exhorted the faithful to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
hold their meetings in the open air. Another preacher of great
reputation at Geneva, Pierre Viret, came to Nismes in the
month of October, 1561, and the day after his arrival, eight
thousand auditors crowded round the foot of his pulpit.</p>

<p>He was suffering from the effects of two attempts at
assassination. A female domestic, gained by some monks,
had tried to poison him at Geneva; and a priest of the
Pays de Vaud, having attacked him on the highway, had so
beaten him that he had been left for dead upon the spot.
“To look at me,” he wrote at a later period, referring to his
first sermon at Nismes, “I appeared like a dry anatomy
covered with skin, who had taken my bones there to be
buried; so much so, that even those who were not of our
religion, but strongly opposed to it, pitied me and said:
‘What is this poor man come to do in our country? Has he
come here to die?’ And I have even heard that, when I
ascended the pulpit for the first time, many seeing me feared
that I should faint before I could finish my sermon.”</p>

<p>He however rendered important services to the Reformation
at Nismes, Lyons, Montpellier, and Orthez. He
preached, according to the testimony of his contemporaries,
with a sweetness and a charm which were peculiarly his own.
It was not the vehemence of Farel, nor the depth of Calvin,
but something unctuous and penetrating, which never wearied
his hearers. Pierre Viret presided in 1563 at the national
synod of Lyons. He has left some controversial writings in
a lively and ingenious style, copies of which appear to have
been well thumbed by the hands of the people.</p>

<p>In this great religious movement, new Catholic churches
were invaded; for in several places there no longer remained
either priests to celebrate the old worship, or believers to
attend. And as crucifixes, images of saints, relics, and other
objects, which the Reformation regarded as monuments of
idolatry, were found in these churches, they were broken or
cast into the fire. These devastations are to be deplored;
Pierre Viret and all wise men opposed them. But how
could it be otherwise? The Reformers but imitated the
early Christians without knowing it, and from the mere
force of circumstances. “On every side,” says M. de Châteaubriand
in his narrative of the fourth century, “temples
were demolished, a loss ever to be lamented for the arts;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
but the material monument fell, <em>as it always will</em>, beneath
the intellectual force of an idea, which has made its way into
the conviction of the human race.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Meetings of eight thousand, fifteen thousand, some historians
say forty thousand, were held at Paris. To
avoid tumults, they were held outside the town. The people
went out and came back by several gates. One of the usual
preachers was Theodore de Bèze, whom the queen-mother
had invited to stay in France, since his presence might be
required. He blessed a court marriage between M. de
Rohan and Mademoiselle de Barbançon, in the presence of
the queen of Navarre and of the prince of Condé, which
inspired greater confidence in the faithful of Paris. The
Reformation was decidedly taking a hold in public and official
acts.</p>

<p>The meetings were divided into two great sections. The
one celebrated its worship outside the gate of Saint Antoine,
at Popincourt; the other in the faubourg Saint Marceau, in
a place called <i lang="fr">Le Patriarche</i>. Several ministers preached at
the same time before multitudes of hearers. The women
placed themselves in the centre, then came the men on foot,
next some men on horseback, and lastly, soldiers or bowmen,
who protected the unarmed crowd.</p>

<p>It is difficult, on account of the contradictory testimony
of contemporaries, to calculate exactly the respective forces
of the two communions. Theodore de Bèze says, that if the
Reformed had determined either at Paris or in the provinces
to employ all their means of action, they could have maintained
the contest with a prospect of success. The Cardinal
de Sainte Croix, a sort of titled spy entertained by Rome in
France from 1561 to 1565, reports in his letters that even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the members of the council were uncertain as to the numerical
force of the parties, and concluded his last letter by
saying that the kingdom was half Huguenot.</p>

<p>Admiral Coligny, on the invitation of the queen-mother,
presented her with a list of more than two thousand five
hundred churches, which demanded liberty of religion, and
placed the persons and the wealth of the Reformed at the
disposal of the king. He referred to flocks united in congregations,
and administered to by regular pastors. To
arrive at an exact estimate, it would be necessary to add the
great mass of new believers, who had not yet been able to
organize themselves according to the rules of discipline.</p>

<p>A letter which, it is said, was written by the Chancellor
l’Hospital, some days before the conference of Poissy, and
sent to the pope Pius IV. from the king, contained the following
curious indications: “The fourth part of this kingdom
is separated from the communion of the Church; and
this fourth part is composed of gentlemen, of the principal
citizens, and of those of the lower classes, who have
seen the world, and are accustomed to bear arms, so that the
separated lack not for strength. Neither are they deficient
in counsel, for they have with them more than three-fourths
of the men of letters. They have no want of money to carry
on their affairs, having on their side a great proportion of
the large and good houses, both of the nobility and of the
Third Estate.”</p>

<p>In raising the number of the Reformed, in this document,
to a fourth of the population, it is probable that the discontented
and undecided were included, in order to render the
pontiff more tractable as to projects of accommodation. But
those historians, who pretend that the Calvinists formed at
this time but a tenth of the population, must fall into a far
more serious error, if we reflect that this minority sustained
long and bloody wars against the (Roman) Catholics in every
part of the kingdom, and always compelled them to consent
to peace. The tenth part of the kingdom could not have
held out so long against the other nine.</p>

<p>At Paris, the markets, the brotherhoods, the workmen,
all the smaller classes, in a word, preserved their attachment
to the old worship. The better order of citizens were
divided; but the majority continued to profess (Roman)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Catholicism. The greater number of the gentry, on the
contrary, had adopted the Reformed faith, or were inclined
to favour it. After the Guises and the court, it was Paris
that saved the Romish church in France.</p>

<p>The position of the Reformed had become false and insupportable
in every way, under the control of the Edict of
July. This edict, which tolerated domestic gatherings and
forbade public meetings, could not be carried into effect. The
new believers, wherever they were numerous, necessarily
overturned the barrier of the law; and on the other hand
the (Roman) Catholic populace, excited by the priests, or
carried away by their own fanaticism, were committing the
greatest atrocities. They bathed in blood at Tours, Sens,
and Cahors. Even at Paris, a conflict—known as the mutiny
of Saint Médard—broke out. Order, rule, and authority
were at an end.</p>

<p>Measures of restraint became necessary. The cardinals
and bishops, true to their spirit of persecution, counselled
the expulsion of all the preachers from the kingdom, and
the extermination of those who should resist; but Catherine
de Medicis and L’Hospital answered that such a course
would instantly lead to civil war. Only one thing appeared
feasible to the chancellor—namely, to give a legal sanction to
the public meetings of the Calvinists, under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Hence the Edict of January, 1562, was deliberated and
adopted in a solemn assembly of the Notables. L’Hospital
then, for the first time, developed the idea of the co-existence
of the two communions. He declared that if the king should
side entirely with one party, he must at once raise an army
to crush the other, and that it would be difficult to make
the soldiers fight against their fathers, brothers, sons, or
dearest friends. “The question is not,” he said, “about
settling religion, but the common weal; for many may be
citizens, who are not Christians. Even an excommunicated
person does not cease to be a citizen, and we may live at
peace with those who are of different opinions, as we see in
the same family, where those who are (Roman) Catholics do
not the less live in peace with, and love those, who are of
the new religion.”</p>

<p>These were the principal provisions of the Edict of January.
Those of the Reformed, who had seized churches and ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
property, were ordered to restore them without
delay. It was forbidden to destroy the images, to break the
crosses, or to commit any other act, which might give occasion
for scandal. It was also forbidden to meet in the interior
of towns by night or by day, but authority was given to
assemble outside the gates, and to preach, pray, and perform
other religious exercises. No one was allowed to go armed
to the assemblies, gentlemen excepted, whilst officers of the
government were to be admitted whenever they chose to be
present.</p>

<p>One clause, which marks the spirit of the epoch, was to
the effect, that the ministers were ordered to swear before
the civil magistrates, that they would preach in conformity
to the Word of God and the Nicene Creed, “<em>in order</em>” said
the edict, “<em>not to fill our subjects with new heresies</em>.” The
pastors did not complain of this; for they saw a barrier in
this obligation against the invasion of doctrines opposed to
their own confession of faith.</p>

<p>The Edict of January answered better to the wants of
Paris and of the northern or central provinces, than to those
of the south. How could whole cities go and worship outside
their walls? and to what purpose was it to restore
churches, which, for want of (Roman) Catholics, must remain
closed? However, Theodore de Bèze and his colleagues,
while confessing that more might have been expected, invited
the faithful, in the name of God, to observe the edict,
and their advice was generally listened to. The religious
edifices were given up; the tithes were paid to the priests;
and the Reformed now busied themselves only in peacefully
organizing their flocks under the protection of the laws.</p>

<p>Not so was it, however, in the opposite camp. The Guises
had refused to assist at the assembly of the Notables; and
Anne de Montmorency only went to protest against the new
decree. The Parliaments of Bordeaux, of Toulouse, Rouen,
and Grenoble, registered the edict without difficulty. The
Parliament of Dijon, on the contrary, under the influence
of the Duke d’Aumale, brother of the Cardinal de Lorraine,
met it with a formidable refusal. The Parliament of Paris
gave way only after several letters of command had been
issued, and added this clause: “In consideration of the
urgent necessity, without approving the new religion, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
until it be otherwise ordered!” This was in effect, while
accepting a law of toleration, to announce the return of
persecution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this resistance, matters had become more
endurable, and the public peace might have been gradually
restored, but that the defection of Anthony de Bourbon,
lieutenant-general of the kingdom, opened the gate to civil
war and the most frightful disasters.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_IV">IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The intrigue was not intended to bring over the Prince
de Condé, and still less Coligny: it was well known that their
hearts were too noble, and their will too strong for this to
take effect. But the king of Navarre offered an easier prey
to seduction, and the legate of the pope, the cardinals, the
Lorraines, the ambassador of Spain, concerted together for
this purpose. The details which follow, are attested even by
the defenders of the Church of Rome: it is necessary to
remember this, in order that they may be believed.</p>

<p>In the first place, they played upon the jealousy of the
king of Navarre, by telling him that, in spite of his title of
lieutenant-general, he was only the second, or even the third,
person of the Calvinist party. Abandoned women were
placed in his way, because his passions were known to incline
him towards ignoble pleasures. Above all, they flattered his
dream of the restitution of the kingdom of Navarre, or of an
equivalent. Philip II., without binding himself in writing,
as we may readily believe, offered him, by his ambassador,
sometimes a kingdom in Africa, at one time that of Tunis,
and at another the island of Sardinia, of which he was to
have the sovereignty on condition of paying a moderate
tribute. The memoirs of the time record the fantastic and
marvellous descriptions made to him of this country: it was
represented to him as one of those fortunate isles that exist
only in fables. The pope, taking part in this comedy, promised
his good offices to secure such a magnificent kingdom
for Anthony de Bourbon.</p>

<p>The historian Davila, favourable as he is to the (Roman)
Catholic party, cannot help sneering at the credulity of the
king of Navarre: “The ambassador Mauriquez,” he says,
“renewed his negotiations by his usual arts; the clauses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
and conditions were discussed as seriously as if a treaty
were to be signed.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Cardinal de Sainte Croix, with
the same frankness, lays open the secrets of this bargain.
Anthony de Bourbon consented to separate himself from
<em>the others</em> (the Calvinists); but he wished first of all to re-enter
into possession of his property, or to obtain a fair equivalent.
Thus we may perceive his conscience truckled for
a kingdom in the clouds.</p>

<p>The Guises laid another trap. They insinuated to the
king of Navarre that he might marry their niece, Mary
Stuart, when the pope had annulled his marriage with
Jeanne d’Albret, on account of heresy; and thus they held
the crown of Scotland before his eyes!</p>

<p>Anthony de Bourbon, dazzled, seduced, won, profited by a
conference between the theologians of the two communions,
to declare that the Calvinist ministers, after all their boasting,
had not been able to withstand the (Roman) Catholic doctors;
and full of violence, like a man who has just sold himself,
he treated them as charlatans and impostors, with whom he
would have nothing more to do. On learning this, the Cardinal
de Lorraine cried out, with an air of triumph, “See
what truth has gained by those conferences, for which I have
been so much reproached!”</p>

<p>Theodore de Bèze, who had been called to France by the
king of Navarre, went to him several times to beseech him
not to abandon the cause of (the Reformed) religion. He
was coldly received: and in a letter to Calvin, dated the
26th of February, 1562, he said, “Never was there witnessed
such an example of treachery and wickedness. In an audience
which he gave me, he was not ashamed to treat me as
if I were ignorant of things, of which even children were
cognizant.”</p>

<p>Calvin wrote pressing letters to the king, but in vain.
Jeanne d’Albret herself employed both tears and prayers
without success. “She excited pity in all who beheld her,”
says Bèze, “except in her husband, the king, so besotted
was he!” Anthony de Bourbon was, in fact, so enraged
against her, as positively to maltreat her; and Jeanne d’Albret,
losing all hope, retired to Béarn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>She was born at Paris, in 1528, and was the only daughter
of Margaret of Valois: she had all the brilliant qualities of
her mother, combined with a firmer piety, and a more
decided character. Her education was solid and well directed.
She understood Greek, Latin, and Spanish, and
wrote verses with facility in a poetical contest with Joachim
du Bellay.</p>

<p>In 1548 she married Anthony de Bourbon, and in 1555,
on the death of her father, she took the name of queen of
Navarre. Jeanne d’Albret was slower than her husband in
embracing the Reformed faith; she only decided in 1560;
but she was unalterably constant to it; and when Catherine
de Medicis advised her to fall in with the altered humour of
the king of Navarre, she made this answer, which marks
the fervour of the newly-converted: “Madame, rather than
ever go to mass, if I had my kingdom and my son in my
hand, I would cast them both into the depths of the sea.”</p>

<p>At the moment of her departure for Béarn, she clasped
her son Henry in her arms, bathed him with her tears, and
beseeched him to preserve the faith, in which he had been
educated. One day Henry IV. had to forget both the
prayers and the farewell of his mother.</p>

<p>When she was once more in her kingdom, Jeanne d’Albret,
taking up the work of Margaret of Valois, opened
schools, colleges, and hospitals, and published a new code—a
precious monument of good sense and wisdom—which
bears the name of <i lang="fr">Stil de la reine Jehanne</i>. Soon there was
not a beggar in Béarn. The children of the poor, who
showed any aptitude for sciences and literature, were educated
at the expense of the treasury. Drunkenness, usury,
and games of hazard were severely repressed. All the arts
flourished with the new faith; and even now, at the end of
three centuries, the people of Béarn pronounce the name of
the <em>good queen</em>, who so greatly raised the prosperity of their
country, with an affectionate veneration.</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Albret had many struggles to sustain, and many
perils to encounter. The Cardinal d’Armagnac reproached
her, in the name of the pope, with having introduced into
her dominions a heresy which had committed so many excesses.
“You make me blush for you,” she answered him:
“Take out the beam from your own eye, to see the mote in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
your neighbour’s; cleanse the earth from that just blood
which you and yours have shed.”</p>

<p>In 1563, Pius IV. cited the queen of Navarre to appear
before the tribunal of the Inquisition within six months,
under pain of forfeiting her crown and her possessions.
Jeanne d’Albert complained of this (insult) to all the sovereigns
of Europe; and Charles IX., on the advice of the
Chancellor l’Hospital, told the pontiff that he was singularly
offended at this attempt to withdraw a subject and vassal of
the crown of France from her natural judges. Once again
the pope gave way. The times of Gregory VII. no longer
existed!</p>

<p>Escaped from this peril, Jeanne d’Albret encountered another.
The historian De Thou relates that the project was
conceived at the court of Madrid, of carrying her off with
her children, in order to hand her over to the Spanish Inquisition.
The wife of Philip II., Elizabeth, a daughter of
France, informed her of this intention, and the plot failed.</p>

<p>If Jeanne d’Albret had been placed on a larger theatre,
she might have been the greatest woman of her age. “She
was,” says the Abbé de Laboureur, in his notes on the Mémoires
de Castelnau, “the wisest, most generous, most learned
princess of her time; she had in her heart the source of
every virtue, and of every great quality.” Agrippa d’Aubigné
says also: “Of woman she had nothing but the sex,
her whole soul belonged to manly things, her powerful spirit
to vast affairs, and her unconquerable heart to great
adversities.”</p>

<p>Whatever excellence Henry IV. possessed of a chivalrous
character, or of love for his people, he inherited from his
noble mother, and France must ever associate the name of
Jeanne d’Albret with that of the most popular of her kings.</p>

<p>The defection of the king of Navarre, lending weight to
the triumvirate, bore the fruit which the (Roman) Catholic
party expected. Coligny and his brothers, seeing that they
were treated with mistrust, withdrew from court. The prince
of Condé, who had hitherto been kept at a distance, went
and fixed himself at Paris; and the Guises thus had full
liberty to commit acts, which in more settled times would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
have been esteemed as high treason against the chief of the
state. They concluded an alliance with the king of Spain
and the duke of Savoy, and undertook to open to them the
gates of the kingdom for the extermination of heretics. At
the same time, they tore up the Edict of January at the
sword’s point, by the massacre of Vassy.</p>

<p>Vassy was a small, but strong town in the county of
Champagne. It contained about three thousand inhabitants,
the third of whom, without counting the surrounding
villages, professed the Reformed faith. This change of religion
irritated the Lorraines, who were established near the
town, in their dominion of Joinville, and in particular a
very aged lady, the dowager-duchess of Guise, who could
not understand why the Huguenots had not already been put
an end to. She pretended that the inhabitants of Vassy
had no right, as vassals of her grand-daughter Mary Stuart,
to choose a new religion without her permission. She therefore
threatened them with a terrible vengeance, and as they
gave no heed to her violence, she invited her son, the duke
Francis of Guise, to make a striking example of such insolent
rebels.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February, 1562, the duke, having received
from the king of Navarre an invitation to return to Paris
to suppress the Huguenots, left the Château of Joinville
with an escort of several gentlemen, and two hundred horsemen.
Arriving the next morning at Brousseval, a village a
quarter of a league distant from Vassy, he heard the sound
of the bells. “What is that?” he asked of one of his attendants.
“That is for the service of the Huguenots.” “By
the mort-Dieu!” exclaimed the duke, “we will Huguenot
them presently after a different fashion.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 1st of March, on entering Vassy, he was
joined by sixty horsemen and bowmen. He dismounted in
front of the hall, and sent for the prior and the provost—both
bitter enemies of the new doctrine. During this time
the Reformed had assembled, to the number of about twelve
hundred, in a barn, and were celebrating their worship under
the protection of the Edict of January. Not one of them
was armed, with the exception of two strangers, probably
gentlemen, who had their swords.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the duke, placed at the head of the escort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
approaching the barn, commenced crying out: “<em>Huguenots,
heretics, dogs, rebels against the king and God!</em>” The faithful
hastened to close the doors, but the assailants leaped from
their horses, crying: “<em>Kill, kill, mort-Dieu! kill these
Huguenots!</em>” The first they met with was a poor hawker
of wine. “In whom do you believe?” they demanded.
“I believe in Jesus Christ,” answered the man; and he was
instantly speared upon the spot. Two others were killed
near the door, and those who showed themselves at the
openings of the barn were fired at from the outside. The
Calvinists had collected stones to defend themselves.</p>

<p>On hearing the tumult, Guise hastened to the spot, and
threw himself into the conflict. He received a blow in the
face from a stone; his blood flowed. His men became exasperated,
and he was beside himself. No pity was shown for
age or sex: a horrible butchery ensued. Some fell on their
knees, their hands clasped, calling for mercy in the name of
Jesus Christ. The answer was: “You call upon your
Christ, where is He now?” Others lifted up the roof, and
sought to escape over the walls of the town. “They were
shot down,” says an old historian, “like pigeons on a roof.”</p>

<p>The pastor, Leonard Morel, was on his knees in his pulpit,
calling upon the God of Mercies. He was fired at when he
sought to fly; but when near the door he tripped over a
corpse, and instantly received several sword-cuts on his right
shoulder, and on his head. Thinking himself fatally wounded,
he cried out: “Lord, into Thy hands I yield my spirit, for
Thou hast redeemed me.”</p>

<p>Two gentlemen, who were near, exclaimed, “This is the
minister; let us take him before M. de Guise.” They
dragged him, for he was not able to walk, and the duke thus
addressed him: “Minister, come here; are you the minister
here? What makes you so bold as to seduce these people?”
“I am no seducer,” answered Morel, “I have preached the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.” “Mort-Dieu,” replied the duke,
“does the Gospel preach sedition? Thou art the cause of
the death of all people; thou shalt be hanged. Provost, up
with a gibbet to hang him!” Happily, out of these hundreds
of cut-throats, no one could be found to fill the office
of executioner. Morel was kept under strict guard, and the
delay saved him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>Sixty persons were left upon the floor after this butchery,
and two hundred more were wounded, several fatally. The
corpses were stripped, and some days after, the footmen of
the duke sold their property in open market, “crying them
aloud,” says Crespin, “as a bailiff would who had taken furniture
in execution.”</p>

<p>During this carnage, the Bible of the Calvinists was
brought to the duke. He gave it to his brother the Cardinal
Louis de Guise, who had remained on the walls of the cemetery.
“Here,” said he, “see the titles of the books of these
Huguenots.” “There is no harm in this,” answered the cardinal;
“it is the Holy Scriptures.” “How, sang-Dieu! the
Holy Scriptures! It is fifteen hundred years and more
since they were made, and these books have only been
printed a year. By the mort-Dieu! it is good for nothing.”
The cardinal could not help saying: “My brother is wrong.”</p>

<p>This circumstance is not unworthy of history: it exhibits,
once more, how profound and degrading was the ignorance
in religious matters of the principal defender of the Romish
church.</p>

<p>The duke was walking up and down, biting his beard, a
sign with him of furious anger. He summoned the judge
of the district, and upbraided him for having suffered these
conventicles. The judge pleaded the Edict of January.
“The Edict of January!” said Guise, laying his hand upon
his sword; “this steel shall speedily cut asunder this edict,
however tightly bound.”</p>

<p>The following day, being at Eclairon, his people informed
him that the Huguenots of Vassy had sent complaints to the
king. “Let them go,” he said with scorn; “they will find
neither their admiral, nor their chancellor.”</p>

<p>Reflection, however, made him understand that it was no
trifling matter to have authorized this butchery in a time
of perfect peace, and he therefore sent a lawyer to Vassy to
commence a sort of inquiry. A tale that the Huguenots
had been the aggressors was invented, as if it were likely
that such an extravagant notion could be believed, that
people unarmed, assembled at the foot of the pulpit with
women and children, should be the first to attack the numerous
escort of François de Guise!</p>

<p>In the following year, when upon his death-bed, the duke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
protested that he had neither premeditated, nor ordered the
massacre of Vassy. We are willing to take him at his word,
notwithstanding the overwhelming remarks of Bayle; it
would grieve us to witness an ignoble leader of a band of
assassins in this brave and valiant captain, the defender
of Metz, the conqueror of Renty. But had he not a firm
resolve to use at least some violence against the Huguenots
of Vassy? What did he do to prevent the massacre?
Was he the man to be disobeyed? Towards the end of the
affair, he ordered, at the request of the duchess of Guise,
that the women with child should be spared, but nothing
more. Moreover did he prosecute, did he so much as disclaim
any one of the murderers? Even the charge of premeditation
he set aside; his consent to the massacre cannot
be denied. The blood of Vassy is on his head: it has been
visited upon him, his son, and his race. “All they who take
the sword, shall perish by the sword.”</p>

<p>The news of the massacre of Vassy created an extraordinary
impression throughout the kingdom; it roused all the
Reformed to indignation and horror. This was not the
crime of a vile populace led on by some contemptible priests,
or abject monks. Here was one of the greatest lords of
France, who had, in contempt of the law, shed the blood of
the faithful in torrents. If this offence were to go unpunished,
where would justice be henceforth, and who could
be secure against assassination?</p>

<p>At Paris the agitation was so great that an immediate
resort to arms was apprehended, and the Marshal de Montmorency,
the governor of the town, invited the faithful to
suspend their assemblies. But they answered that this
would be to give up the cause to their enemies, and to
acknowledge that there existed a power superior to that of
the law in the kingdom. They, however, restricted themselves
to demanding from the marshal the compulsory observance
of the edict.</p>

<p>The prince of Condé and the principal members of the
party addressed themselves to Catherine de Medicis. They
represented to her the insolence of the triumvirate, the
league of the Lorraine princes with the king of Spain, the
growing audacity of their enterprises, the dangers which
threatened the royal authority, and protested that they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
ready to sacrifice their possessions and their lives for the
cause of the throne, which was now linked with the Reformed
faith. Catherine employed her usual dissimulation, gave
evasive answers, and tried to penetrate the secrets of the
Calvinists, in order to turn them to her own account, as
occasion might serve, for or against them.</p>

<p>The consistory of Paris resolved to exhaust every legal
means before opposing force to force, and sent Theodore de
Bèze to the court to demand the exemplary punishment of
the murderers. The king of Navarre, who was present at
the audience, and who wished to give some testimony of his
zeal to his new allies, exclaimed: “They threw stones at my
brother, the duke of Guise; he could not restrain the fury
of his people; and mark me, whosoever shall touch but the
end of his finger, shall touch my whole body.” “Sire,”
Bèze answered, “it is indeed the part of the Church of
God, in whose name I speak, to endure blows and not to
give them; but you will also please to remember that it is
an anvil, which has used up many hammers.”</p>

<p>Theodore de Bèze spoke the truth. Anthony of Bourbon
and his have fallen; the persecutors rest in their sepulchre,
but the French Reformation still lives.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_VI">VI.</h3>
</div>


<p>We now come to the wars of religion. The history of
the Reformed at this juncture becomes the general history of
France, and as that is related in writings without number,
which are in everybody’s hands, we shall only give a rapid
summary of the principal facts, directing our especial attention
to whatever may serve to depict the private life of the
oppressed party.</p>

<p>The duke of Guise made a triumphal entry into Paris.
The priests urged on the multitude to crowd the path of the
man of Vassy, whilst comparing him to Judas Maccabæus,
and awarding to him the glorious name of <em>defender of the
faith</em>. Catherine de Medicis was offended at this triumph
both in her pride as queen-mother, and in her right as
regent; but the duke left her no time to concert a league
with the Calvinists. Encouraged by the support of the king
of Navarre, of Anne of Montmorency, and of the Marshal de
Saint André, he carried off Charles IX. and Catherine herself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and dragged them from Fontainebleau to Melun, from Melun
to Vincennes, and from Vincennes to Paris. These were the
days of the 5th and 6th October of the triumvirate.</p>

<p>Where legitimate authority now rested was unknown.
The sovereignty was floating about at hap-hazard. The Reformed
were in some sort placed beyond the law by the
enterprises of the man, who had recently massacred their
brethren; they found themselves thrown into an attitude of
personal defence. So, from one end of France to the other,
without preliminary concert, they flew to arms, just as one
would do when he sees his house broken into at midnight
by a band of robbers.</p>

<p>“It is ever to be remembered,” says an historian of the
sixteenth century, “that so long as the Reformed were put
to death under any form of justice, however iniquitous and
cruel, they held out their necks, and offered no resistance.
But when public authority, in the person of the magistracy,
wearied of burnings, flung the knife into the hands of the
people, and the tumults and enormous massacres of France
had torn away the venerable aspect of justice, and had made
neighbour to slaughter neighbour at the sound of trumpet
and drum, who could forbid the wretched to oppose arm to
arm, steel to steel, and to catch from a fury without justice
the contagion of a just fury?... Let foreign nations judge
which of the two parties have their foreheads stained with
the crime of war!”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The queen-mother seemed to authorize the Huguenots’ resort
to arms, and even to solicit it in the name of Charles IX.
“My cousin,” she wrote to the prince of Condé, “you will take
care to preserve the children and the mother, and the kingdom
for him whom it concerns, by whom you may rest assured
it will never be forgotten. If I die before I have an opportunity
of showing my gratitude, as I wish to do, I will leave
instructions to my children. I see so many things which
grieve me, that were it not for the confidence I feel in you,
that you will aid me in preserving this kingdom and the
authority of the king, my son, in spite of those who would
lose all, I should be yet more grieved.” These letters, communicated
to the gentry of the religion, strengthened them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
in their projects: for they believed they were upholding not
only their own cause, but that of the crown.</p>

<p>Both sides invited foreign aid into the kingdom. The
(Roman) Catholics set the example; the Roman pontiff
preached a crusade in Italy and Spain similar to that of Simon
de Montfort against the Albigeois, and the Huguenots, in
their turn, claimed the assistance of every Protestant nation.
Under one or the other banner, Spaniards, Swiss, Germans,
and Englishmen were speedily ranged. So will it ever be in
the great wars of religious or political principles. Men then
separate themselves, not people from people, but faith from
faith, because something is at stake more powerful than
nationality itself, and because country is only dear when it
realizes the mighty convictions, which have taken possession
of their souls. If a struggle were to break out in Europe
to-morrow for the fundamental principles of politics, what
occurred in the sixteenth century would be seen again; the
only difference would be in the device of the colours and the
watchword of the combatants.</p>

<p>Each party published long manifestoes, another inevitable
occurrence in a war of principles. The Calvinists demanded
the strict execution of the Edict of January, the restoration
to liberty of the king and queen-mother,—who, they declared,
were prisoners,—the punishment of the authors of the crime
of Vassy, or at least, the withdrawal of the duke of Guise,
and of the two other triumvirs, to their houses. The (Roman)
Catholics answered, respecting the Edict of January, by equivocal
phrases; as to the liberation of the king and queen, they
asserted that they were perfectly free; as to the punishment
of the authors of the affair of Vassy, that there was no one
to punish; and with regard to the retreat of the members
of the triumvirate, that their presence was essential to the
public good.</p>

<p>The most remarkable document of these preliminary discussions
is the act of association, which was concluded between
the prince of Condé and the Calvinist lords, on the 11th of
April, 1562, after the celebration of the communion. All
avowed that they had only in this alliance the honour of God
before their eyes, the liberation of the king and of the queen,
the maintenance of the edicts, and the punishment of those
who had violated them. They solemnly swore to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
blasphemy, violence, pillage, all that is forbidden by the law
of God, and to establish good and faithful ministers, who
should teach them to do His will. They appointed the prince
of Condé the chief and leader of their enterprise, as being of
the blood royal and protector of the crown of France.
Lastly, they promised, on their hope of Paradise, to fulfil
their duty with unshrinking fidelity.</p>

<p>Their first deeds of arms were fortunate. Orleans, Tours,
Bourges, Poitiers, Rouen, Le Hâvre, Lyons, Montauban,
Nismes, and the greater number of the strong castles of
Normandy, of Poitou, of Saintonge, of Guienne, of Languedoc,
and of Dauphiné, fell into their hands almost without a
blow, towards the end of April.</p>

<p>The triumvirate, on their side, acted with vigour. They
dictated at their discretion the resolutions of the Council and
the decrees of the Parliaments. They strove especially to
bind the people of Paris, without reservation, to their fortunes.
The (Roman) Catholic citizens were armed and
formed into regiments. Fifty thousand men were counted
upon at the first sound of the tocsin. The commune sat <i lang="fr">en
permanence</i>. Chains were placed at the corners of the streets,
to barricade them, in case of attack. Certificates of (Roman)
Catholicism were required from all the procureurs, receivers,
constables, and other public officers. The churches were the
clubs of the time; they were still more so under the League.</p>

<p>The Huguenots received orders to quit Paris in twenty-four
hours under pain of death. The infamous accusations
of former years were again brought against them. Coarse
prints were constantly circulated, representing the heretics
tearing out the bowels of the monks, and casting their victims
before swine. The fanaticism of the populace was raised by
these provocations to the blindest pitch of frenzy, and it was
enough to pass for a Huguenot in the streets to be instantly
slaughtered. Theodore de Bèze cites many instances of these
facts.</p>

<p>The triumvirs and the priests knew very well what they
would gain by seizing upon the opinion of this powerful city.
“Paris,” says the historian Davila, “alone gave more credit,
and more weight, than one-half of the kingdom could have
given.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>Coligny felt this. He advised the prince of Condé to
march direct upon Paris, urging that the triumvirs had as
yet no army, and that a multitude without discipline might
be easily overcome. Condé refused. Brother of the king of
Navarre, and looking forward to be one day lieutenant-general
of the kingdom, he was obliged to act with circumspection
even towards his most violent adversaries. A prince
of the blood is not the man to lead a party in those critical
moments, when all must be hazarded to conquer all. Would
the English Puritans have triumphed, if they had chosen
a member of the royal family for their chief instead of
Cromwell?</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis proposed to open conferences between
the two parties. It was the only plan, by which she could
still make any figure. In the struggles of warriors she could
do nothing; in negotiations she relied upon her genius, and
flattered herself that she could entangle the heads of the
(Roman) Catholics, as well as of the Reformed, in her intrigues.</p>

<p>A first conference was held on the 2nd of June, at Thoury,
in Beauce. It was agreed that each party should meet, with
an equal escort of gentlemen, who should keep aloof, at a distance
of eight hundred paces from each other. But whilst
the chiefs debated, the gentlemen drew near together; in
fact, they yearned towards each other. On a sudden, old
friendships rekindled; party quarrels were forgotten; there
were no longer Papists and Huguenots, but mingling embraces
and tears; they only remembered that they had spent
their childhood together, had drunk out of the same cup, and
slept under the same roof. Sacred instinct of the heart! It
inspired better emotions than the science of theologians, or
the politics of statesmen!</p>

<p>The queen-mother had conceived, with the bishop Montluc,
her private counsellor, a strange expedient. It was to engage
the chiefs of the two parties to impose on themselves a
voluntary exile. The triumvirs were to withdraw from the
court; the prince of Condé, the admiral, and the principal
Calvinists, were to leave the kingdom until the majority of
Charles IX., that the religious differences might be peaceably
arranged. Such an idea was but a court stratagem, which
could settle nothing.</p>

<p>Much time had been lost. The Calvinist gentlemen, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
had to maintain themselves at their own expense, were
beginning to return home, and the army of the triumvirs
was increasing. This was perceived by the increase of persecution.
The Parliament of Paris passed a decree, at the end
of June, commanding heretics to be set upon, and to be
killed, wherever they should be met, like madmen, who were
enemies of God and man. Every Sunday the curates were to
read this dreadful decree from the pulpit. The peasants, the
workmen, armed themselves with whatever weapon came to
hand, and began to scour the country, as if to rid it of wild
beasts. The monks, in their hideous language, called this
“letting slip the great greyhound.”</p>

<p>A new decree of the Parliament, passed on the 18th of
August, declared all the gentlemen of the new religion, with
the exception of the prince of Condé, traitors to God and the
king, and summoned them to appear in three days, in default
of which they were to be punished by the confiscation of their
bodies and their goods.</p>

<p>It was then that the Calvinists determined to press
D’Andelot to bring some lansquenets from Germany, and to
conclude a treaty with Elizabeth, queen of England, by which
she undertook to furnish a force of six thousand men. Three
thousand were to land at Havre-de-Grâce, and three thousand
were to serve for the defence of Dieppe and Rouen,
which were in the hands of Condé. This treaty was signed
on the 20th of September, 1562, and Queen Elizabeth published
a manifesto, in which she affirmed before heaven and
before the world, that she had no other object, but to defend
the loyal subjects of King Charles IX., her brother, against
the tyranny of their oppressors.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_VII">VII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The duke of Guise and his confederates hastened to lay
siege to the town of Rouen. The count of Montgomery,
the same who had mortally wounded Henry II. in a tournay,
took the command, and had with him a devoted population,
and a strong garrison.</p>

<p>Between the besiegers and the besieged a contrast might be
observed, which was to be reproduced eighty years later, between
the Puritans of Cromwell and the royalist cavaliers. In
the (Roman) Catholic army licentiousness reigned. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
de Medicis, who had turned to the strongest side, had brought
with her her maids of honour. The trenches were opened
to the sound of serenades, and the damsels of the court,
constituting themselves the judges of the camp, awarded
prizes to the cavaliers. In the interior of the town all was
sober and severe. Here were no games or spectacles, but
only sermons, prayers, and psalms; and after the religious
service, the women went to the ramparts to fight by the side
of their husbands.</p>

<p>After a siege of five weeks, Rouen was taken by assault,
and given up for eight days to the fury of the soldiery. The
Parliament, which had retired to Louviers, came to complete
the work by judicial murders. Several of the principal
inhabitants were condemned to death, among others Jean de
Mandreville, president of the “<span lang="fr">cour des aides</span>,” and the
pastor Augustin Marlorat.</p>

<p>This last had figured at the conference of Poissy. He was
versed in science, and possessed piety and moderation of
character, and enjoyed the esteem of the faithful. The
constable wished to see Marlorat, and accused him of having
seduced the people. “If I have seduced them,” answered
the minister of Christ, “God first seduced me; for I have
preached to them the simple Word of God.” While they
were dragging him on a hurdle to the gibbet, he exhorted
his fellow-sufferers to glorify God to their last breath.</p>

<p>Anthony de Bourbon was mortally wounded during this
siege, and licentious passions, which he could not subdue,
hastened his end. After having received the viaticum, on
the entreaty of a court-bishop, he appeared in his last moments
to return to the Reformed faith; for he requested
his physician to read the Bible to him, and with his eyes full
of tears he prayed to God for pardon, declaring that if he
recovered, he would cause the Gospel to be preached throughout
the kingdom. But it was too late. Anthony de Bourbon
died at the age of forty-four, and the only funeral oration
that can be made over him is that of Etienne Pasquier:
“The king of Navarre is dead, from a gun-shot; he is regretted
neither by one party, nor the other!”</p>

<p>On the 19th of December the battle of Dreux was fought.
The Calvinist army consisted of four thousand cavalry and five
thousand infantry; the (Roman) Catholic army of sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
thousand foot and two thousand horse. These forces were but
small for an encounter, which might produce most important
results; but, even of these, the foreign mercenaries of the triumvirs
amounted to two-thirds, and to one-half in those of
the Huguenots. But the war was at that time carried on from
one end of France to the other; every province, every town,
and, in some sort, every hamlet, had its soldiers; so that the
troops encamped near Dreux formed but the smallest number
of the combatants.</p>

<p>For more than two hours, the armies gazed at each other
in sullen stillness. “Each one thought within himself,” as
relates the honest Lanoue, “that he had relations, friends,
and comrades before him.” At length the battle began, and
was kept up for seven hours with excessive ferocity. Eight
thousand dead bodies encumbered the plain at the end of
day.</p>

<p>The Calvinists had at first the advantage, and some runaways
having carried the news to Paris, Catherine de
Medicis coolly replied: “Well, we must pray to God in
French.”</p>

<p>But the duke of Guise, having charged with the reserve,
changed the face of the combat. Coligny tried in vain to
bring his men back to the attack; all he could effect, was
to retreat in good order. The chiefs of the two armies, the
prince of Condé and the Constable de Montmorency, were
taken prisoners. The Marshal de Saint André, one of the
triumvirate, fell upon the field. “Die, traitor,” said a Calvinist
officer, in discharging a pistol at his head, “die by the
hand of one whom thou hast despoiled.”</p>

<p>The winter did not suspend hostilities. Coligny again took
the field in Upper and Lower Normandy. The duke of Guise
went to besiege Orleans, the principal place, and the centre
of the war-operations of the Calvinists. “Once take the
burrow, when the foxes have retreated,” said he, “and we
will chase them all over France.”</p>

<p>Already, in spite of the heroic defence of D’Andelot and
the citizens, two suburbs had been taken, and the tower of
the bridge had been carried, when the duke of Guise was
wounded on the evening of the 18th of February, 1563,

Jean Poltrot de Méré</ins>, who fired a pistol close to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
breast. He died six days after, bitterly regretted by the
(Roman) Catholic party. They gave him at Paris the funeral
of a king, and Catherine de Medicis assumed great grief,
which she did not feel.</p>

<p>Several historians,—Mézeray among others,—assure us,
that in his last moments he advised the queen-mother to make
peace as quickly as possible; adding, that whosoever prevented
it would be an enemy to the king and to the state.
This was to counsel toleration, since peace could not be
firmly established, except on this condition. Did François de
Guise better understand his duty at the hour of death, than
he had done throughout his life? Perhaps he did. Ambition
no longer led him astray, and the thought of the judgment
of God might have inspired him with the words of truth.</p>

<p>The murderer of the Duke de Guise was a gentleman of
Angoumois, at that time twenty-five or twenty-six years old.
An ardent (Roman) Catholic in his youth, Poltrot had served
in Spain, and had so far adopted the language and manners
of that country, as to have been called by the nickname of
<i lang="es">Espagnolet</i>. Having embraced the Reformed faith, he was
compelled to fly to Geneva, and to follow the trade of an
artisan for a livelihood. His temper was soured and his
imagination excited. Returned to France, he heard on
every side loud complaints against the duke of Guise, whom
the Huguenots called the <em>butcher of Vassy</em>, and the destruction
of the murderer of his brethren appeared to him an act
of legitimate reprisal. Such were the deplorable effects of
these wars of religion, which distorted all ideas of justice,
and depraved the soul—abyss only leading to abyss!</p>

<p>The death of the duke of Guise changed the face of affairs.
Anne de Montmorency being a prisoner, there was no longer
in the (Roman) Catholic army any chief of renown, and
Catherine de Medicis resumed the negotiations, which she
had never entirely abandoned. She tried to seduce Condé
by the promise of the lieutenancy-general of the kingdom.
This prince, who had fallen into the hands of the (Roman)
Catholics at the battle of Dreux, had lived for three months
apart from the austere men of the Calvinist party; “<em>he
already breathed</em>,” says Mézeray, “<em>the soft air of the court, and
of the gaieties of the ladies</em>.” Won over by the artifices of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the queen, he asked leave to go and treat for peace at
Orleans.</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived, he addressed these two questions
to the pastors: Whether it were reasonable to exact that
the Edict of January should be restored in all its articles? or,
on the other hand, if that could not be obtained, whether it
would not be desirable to enter into arrangements with the
queen to quell the disorders of the kingdom? The pastors,
to the number of seventy-two, seeing him hesitate, addressed
a remonstrance to him in writing, asking for a fair and safe
exercise of their religion, both in the places where it already
existed, and in such places where the inhabitants might
claim it.</p>

<p>The prince paid no heed to this remonstration, and despairing
of overcoming the resistance of the ministers, turned
to the gentlemen, who he knew were tired of war, and communicated
to them certain clauses, which accorded to the
nobility religious privileges. The pastoral body was neither
heard nor received in this conference, and the majority of
the gentlemen accepted the proposed articles.</p>

<p>The queen-mother vehemently urged on the conclusion;
she feared to lose a single day, because she foresaw that if
the Admiral Coligny had time to come up, the entire edifice
of her intrigues would fall at a blow. Therefore, as soon as
the prince of Condé had returned, she signed the articles,
and this treaty, drawn up under the form of an edict of pacification,
was published at Amboise on the 19th of March,
1563.</p>

<p>It contained the following points: Free exercise of religion
in those towns, which were in the power of the Calvinists
at the date of the 7th of March, 1563; permission
to the lords <i lang="fr">haut-justiciers</i> to hold assemblies throughout
the whole extent of their domains; permission to the nobles
of the second rank to celebrate their worship in their own
houses, but only for their households; finally, in each bailiwick
pertaining directly to the Parliaments, the concession
of a single place of worship. To all the other members of
the Reformed faith, it accorded only private worship:
“Every one,” said the treaty, “shall be permitted to live at
liberty in his own house, without search or molestation, and
without being forced or constrained for conscience’ sake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Truly, there was a wide difference between the articles of
Amboise and the Edict of January. Instead of a general
right, the mass of the Reformed had now but the toleration
of their domestic hearths. The nobles alone, and the faithful
who dwelt in the neighbourhood of a bailiwick-town,
could hold assemblies. This was separating the disciples of
the Reformation like persons sick with the plague in a
lazaretto.</p>

<p>When the Admiral learned the contents of this treaty, he
felt the most lively indignation. “This stroke of the pen,”
said he, “ruins more churches than the enemy could have
pulled down in ten years.”</p>

<p>He returned to Orleans by forced marches, and arrived on
the 23rd of March, hoping still to find the means of obtaining
better conditions. He presented himself before the
council, and explained his dissatisfaction to the prince.
He said that the affairs of religion were in a favourable
state; that two of the principal authors of the war were
dead, and the third a prisoner; that, in confining the assemblies
to one town in a bailiwick and to the lords <i lang="fr">haut-justiciers</i>,
the poor, who had nevertheless set the example to
the rich, were sacrificed; and lastly, that the gentlemen
themselves who wished to do their duty, would soon feel
what heavy chains they had accepted.</p>

<p>This discourse made so strong an impression, that many,
who had taken the advice of Condé, would have wished that
the whole matter were to be done over again. But the prince
answered that he had received private promises, and that
when he was lieutenant-general of the kingdom, all would
go on well. Coligny had to give way. Orleans was restored
to the king’s troops, and the Huguenots aided them in retaking
Hâvre from the English.</p>

<p>Such was the end of the first religious war, if such a word
can be used to designate a simple suspension of arms, adopted
on each side with mental reservations. No one was or could
be satisfied. The ardent (Roman) Catholics complained no less
than the Calvinists. Politicians could not understand those
categories, which surrendered to a few what was refused to the
masses. No principle had dictated the Edict of Pacification,
and France, covered with blood, had not even time to apply
the first dressing to her grievous wounds.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h3 id="BII_VIII">VIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Having set forth the course of general affairs, it is now
necessary to cast a glance at what had been going on in
the provinces. War was waged not only between party chiefs
and regular armies; it also broke out in a thousand forms
throughout the kingdom. It was a great and fearful struggle
of province against province, town against town, house
against house, and man against man. Never was it so
clearly seen that the worst of all wars are civil wars, and of
all civil wars the wars of religion.</p>

<p>The excesses of the revolution would convey but a faint
idea [of the then state of things]. Fanaticism had converted
France into a band of cannibals, and the gloomiest imagination
may be defied to conceive all the kinds of refined, revolting,
execrable, and obscene punishments which were
then practised. But there is in this spectacle a great lesson
to be learned: it is that the principle of religious liberty is
one of the most precious possessions of humanity.</p>

<p>A detailed recital of these horrors is not here to be expected.
They fill a volume of Theodore de Bèze. Jacques
de Thou devotes to them several books of his history. Crespin,
Jean de Serres, the memoirs of Montluc, of Tavanes, of
Condé, of Lanoue, and of fifty others are full of them. Whoever
wishes to investigate the details may seek for them
there. Were we to attempt the task, the pen would again
and again fall from our hand.</p>

<p>The Huguenots had observed a rigid discipline at the outset
of the campaign. Having newly taken up the cross and
risen at the call of their conscience, they wished to absolve
their arms by the austerity of their lives. There were no
women in their camps; no cards or dice; no blasphemy; no
profane discourse; no maurauding or pillage. The nobles
paid in money for all that they took for themselves or for
their followers. Those who committed violence were punished.
A lord of Dammartin, who had outraged the daughter
of a villager, narrowly escaped execution. Another was
hanged at Orleans for adultery; and this, much more than
any differences of doctrine had done, aroused the dissolute
court of Catherine de Medicis.</p>

<p>At morning and evening, public prayers were said. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
ministers, distributed by companies, maintained good order
by their exhortations. A prayer has been preserved which
was repeated in the army. The Calvinists addressed supplications
to God for the king, the queen-mother, the princes of
the royal blood, and the members of the council.</p>

<p>The same discipline prevailed at Orleans. “Besides the
ordinary sermons and the prayers to the <i lang="fr">corps de garde</i>,”
says Theodore de Bèze, “extraordinary general prayers were
said at six o’clock in the morning, after which, the ministers
and the people without exception went to work at the fortifications
with all their strength, each one returning at four
o’clock in the evening to prayers; a place was also set apart
for the wounded, who were most humanely tended by the
most distinguished ladies of the town, who spared neither
their money nor their labour.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately this lasted only for a few months; Coligny
had foreseen it. “This discipline is indeed a noble thing,”
said he, “as long as it lasts; but I fear these people will
throw down all their goodness at once. I have commanded
infantry, and I know them; they often fulfil the proverb
which says: ‘<em>out of a young hermit grows an old devil</em>.’”</p>

<p>Religious passions, added to the want of money, drove the
Huguenots to carry off the ornaments of the churches.
They broke the sacred vessels, mutilated the statues of the
saints, and dispersed the relics. These excesses excited in
the hearts of the (Roman) Catholics a rage impossible to be
described. “You knock down the images,” they said; “you
destroy the relics of the dead; well! we will knock down
as many living images as fall into our hands.”</p>

<p>The decrees of the Parliaments added fuel to the popular
fury, by giving it a semblance of justice. The peasant left
his plough, the artisan his trade. The [Roman Catholic
bands] consisted of people of no calling, vagabonds, and
beggars, and free companies armed with reaping-hooks, knives,
and pikes. They chose a captain at hazard, some famous
brigand, or else a monk, or curate; sometimes even a bishop;
and these bands, drunk with fanaticism and revenge, respected
neither law, modesty, nor pity. In Champagne they were
called “<em>naked-feet</em>” (<i lang="fr">pieds-nus</i>).</p>

<p>They fell upon the Calvinists by surprise, massacred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
men, outraged the women, demolished the houses, tore down
the vines, rooted up the trees, and desolated entire cantons.
“There are too many people in France,” cried out a leader
of these ruffians, “I will kill a sufficient number to make
provisions cheap.”</p>

<p>The Huguenots, it may be believed, also resorted to reprisals;
but being less numerous, and mostly belonging to the
more cultivated classes, they did less harm than they suffered.</p>

<p>The excesses, serious everywhere, were especially so to the
south of the Loire, on account of the great number of the
Reformed, and the ardent character of the population. At
Cahors, five hundred Huguenots were attacked one Sunday
while they were at service, and the bishop, Pierre Bertrandi,
had them all butchered to the last man. At Montauban the
inhabitants had quitted their town at the approach of the
(Roman) Catholic bands; but having been massacred in
crowds, the survivors returned within their walls, and sustained
three sieges with heroic constancy.</p>

<p>The events which happened at Toulouse in May, 1562,
will serve to characterize what was passing throughout the
whole extent of the southern provinces.</p>

<p>This town contained from twenty-five to thirty thousand
of the Reformed, for the most part, burghers, merchants,
professors of the university, men of letters, students, and
magistrates. They had chosen municipal officers of their
own persuasion. “Toulouse,” says an old chronicle, “is
governed by a mixture of magistrates of three kinds: Catholics,
Huguenots, and Temporizers—people, however, of
elevated minds, adorned with many graces, rich and opulent;
and there is even a fourth kind, namely, that of the ancient
heresy (probably that of the Albigeois), which had already
taken root.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>After the publication of the Edict of January, the Reformed
had built a wooden church outside the gates of the town,
which would hold from five to six thousand persons. They
went there in open day, and the women were not less zealous
than the men. “They had laid aside with their prayer-books
and the beads which they had worn at their girdles,” says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
our chronicler, “their ample robes, and dissolute garments,
dances, and worldly songs, as if they had been guided by the
Holy Ghost: all of which our preachers could not obtain
from the Catholics with all their holy admonitions.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The majority of the Parliament continued to protect the
ancient worship; and the people, goaded by the imprecations
of the monks, attacked the Calvinists on the least pretext
and pillaged their houses. All was violence, disorder,
anarchy!</p>

<p>Driven to extremes, and headed by some of their municipal
magistrates, the Reformed took possession of the <i lang="fr">Maison-de-Ville</i>,
or Capitol, on the night of the 11th or 12th of May.</p>

<p>The councillors of the Parliament immediately passed a
sentence of arrest against the magistrates who had taken
part in this affair, and sent round to demand the armed
assistance of all the captains and gentlemen of the surrounding
country. Then they presented themselves to the people
in red robes, commanding them to take arms and seize the
heretics dead or alive. “Pillage, kill boldly, with the approval
of the pope, of the king, and of the court,” cried out
five or six frenzied councillors, whilst traversing the streets.</p>

<p>The struggle became horrible. The Calvinists who had
not been able to take refuge in the Hôtel de Ville were seized
in their houses, thrown out of the windows, or dragged to
the Garonne. Wretches, whom the constables were taking
to prison, were massacred on their way, whilst no mercy was
shown to well-dressed passengers! It was taken for granted
that every one, who was not a labouring man, a member of
the Parliament, a monk or a priest, must be a heretic.</p>

<p>Another characteristic circumstance of the struggle, was
that the people, imagining all cultivation of the mind to be
a commencement of heresy, crowded at once around the
shops of the booksellers, and burned all the books they contained
in the public places. These wretched men, who could
not read, thought they were thus doing the work of good
(Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>The tocsin rang from all the churches, for five or six
leagues round. Bands of peasantry poured into the town,
attracted by the hope of plunder. The Reformed, besieged
in the Capitol, had cannon, and defended themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
from the Monday to the Saturday, with all the courage of
despair.</p>

<p>Reduced at length to the last extremity, without food for
their wives and children, or powder to load their arms, the
people having also fired the whole quarter near the Capitol,
they demanded a parley, crying: <i lang="fr">Vive la Croix! Vive la
Croix!</i> They were promised their lives, on condition of
leaving their arms and effects in the <i lang="fr">Maison-de-Ville</i>. Before,
however, they departed, they celebrated the Holy Communion
with many prayers and tears, and began, between eight
and nine in the evening, to retreat by the gate of Villeneuve.
But the labourers and peasants, whom the priests had taught
that it was not binding on them to keep faith with heretics,
fell on them, and it is reckoned that three thousand five
hundred persons perished in these conflicts.</p>

<p>The Parliament next proceeded to judicial executions.
They first mutilated their own body, by excluding twenty-two
councillors, who, without being Huguenots, had allowed
their wives, or other members of their families, to frequent
the sermons. Up to the month of March, 1563, the provost
of the town and three hundred other heretics had been put
to death, and four hundred persons were also condemned to
the same penalty for contumacy. The clergy had published
a monition enjoining, under pain of excommunication and
eternal damnation, not only the denunciation of heretics, but
even of those, who had given them counsel, help, or favour.</p>

<p>Acts of atrocious fanaticism were committed. It is related
that a boy of twelve or thirteen years, who had come from
Montauban to Toulouse, was called upon to recite the <i lang="la">Ave
Maria</i>. He answered that it had not been taught him, and
for that reason alone he was taken to the gallows.</p>

<p>In the midst of so many frightful crimes, Blaise de Montluc
and the Baron des Adrets had still the frightful honour of distinguishing
themselves by their cruelty. The first, a rude and
ignorant soldier, was the most ferocious of all the (Roman)
Catholic chiefs of the south. He seemed to enjoy a wild
and insatiable delight in spectacles of blood, and he has himself
related in his <cite>Commentaries</cite>, with the utmost coolness, all
the executions he had ordered. He was constantly attended
by two executioners armed with hatchets well sharpened,
who were called his <i lang="fr">laquais</i>. He ordered the Huguenots to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
be hanged or beheaded without interrogation; “<em>for they</em>,”
he said, “<em>have a golden tongue</em>.” The roads, by which he
passed, were known by the bodies hanging on the trees. Nor
did he neglect to take care of his fortune; he knew how to
pick up gold out of blood. “He who, heretofore, had but
little mercy,” says Brantôme, “found himself at the end of
the war possessed of a hundred thousand crowns.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He was
rewarded for his exploits by the bâton of a marshal of France.</p>

<p>But pitiless as he was, he once encountered men who surpassed
him. They were Spaniards, <ins class="corr" id="tn-143" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'whom Philp II. had'">
whom Philip II. had</ins> sent to the assistance of the (Roman) Catholic party. Having
taken a little town in Agenois, Montluc put all those to the
sword who had defended the castle, and sent back the women
by a staircase hollowed out of the wall. The Spaniards, who
were waiting for them in the court, butchered them all together,
with the little children they carried in their arms.
When Montluc reproached them for this, they answered with
<i lang="fr">sang-froid</i>, “We thought they were Lutherans in disguise
(<i lang="es">todos Luteranos tapados</i>).”</p>

<p>The Baron des Adrets, who led some of the Huguenot
bands, showed himself no less barbarous than Montluc. He
had embraced the new religion on account of an action,
which he accused the duke of Guise of having caused him
to lose. He spread terror in the Lyonnais, Dauphiné, Provence,
and the county of Avignon. But the chiefs of the
Calvinist party were soon ashamed of, and shocked at his
crimes, and sent Soubise to Lyons to restrain him. They
even made him prisoner at Valence, and he was only set at
liberty at the conclusion of the peace, which he resented so
much, that he returned to the Romish communion and died
a Papist.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_IX">IX.</h3>
</div>


<p>Catherine de Medicis did not, as she had promised, make
the prince of Condé lieutenant-general of the kingdom. She
caused her son to be declared to have attained his majority,
in a <i lang="fr">lit de justice</i> held at the Parliament of Rouen, on the
17th of August, 1563. Charles IX. was then thirteen years
and two months old. This prince was not deficient in natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
intelligence; he was fond of literature, and, under better
discipline, might have prepared himself to have worn the
crown worthily. But his mother had early trained him to
be treacherous, dissimulating, suspicious, and eager for
bloody spectacles. She had given him for his preceptor a
man from her town of Florence, Albert Gondi, afterwards
named Marshal de Retz, who, according to Brantôme, was
cunning, cautious, corrupt, lying, a great dissembler, swearing,
and denying God like a porter.</p>

<p>The Edict of Pacification was not executed. Several Parliaments
would only consent to register it after long resistance.
The governors of the provinces relaxed or tightened
the clauses of the edict at their pleasure; and the states of
Burgundy, directed by the Duke d’Aumale, even dared to
declare that they could no more endure two religions, than
heaven could bear two suns.</p>

<p>In the districts where the (Roman) Catholics were the
strongest, they represented themselves as defiled by the
neighbourhood of heresy, and gave themselves up to shameful
acts of violence against the faithful, who went to the
assemblies. They violated even the sanctity of the domestic
hearth, maltreating those who sung psalms, compelling the
Huguenots to furnish bread for the parochial masses, and to
give money to the church societies. When the oppressed
appealed to the laws, they were answered by blows, sometimes
by assassinations. More than three thousand of them
perished by a violent death after the signing of the peace.</p>

<p>Where, on the other hand, the Calvinists were in the majority,
they did not obey the Edict of Amboise, nor could
they have done so, had they wished; for this treaty had
been made rather for the north, than for the south of France.
Imagine fifty to a hundred thousand persons compelled to
take a journey of several leagues to celebrate their worship
in a privileged town!</p>

<p>(Roman) Catholics and the Reformed were not united in
the same society: they were encamped face to face, erect,
and with arms in their hands. The (Roman) Catholics began,
from the year 1563, under the influence of the cardinals and
bishops, to form themselves into leagues or private associations
for the extirpation of heresy. They bound themselves
to devote their persons and their goods, without reservation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
[to their cause]. The Calvinists, on their side, had their
battle-fields, their rallying-signs, watchwords, and plans of
campaign. They were two great armies, who were engaged
in constant skirmishes, while waiting for the hour and the
place of battle.</p>

<p>In 1564, Catherine de Medicis made Charles IX. traverse
the provinces of his kingdom, in order to rekindle the affection
of the (Roman) Catholics, and to intimidate the Huguenots.
When she arrived at Roussillon, a little town of
Dauphiné, she published, on the 4th of August, an <em>interpretative</em>
declaration of the Edict of Amboise. The lords <i lang="fr">haut-justiciers</i>
were no longer to admit any but the members of
their families, and their immediate vassals, to their assemblies.
It was forbidden to the churches to hold synods, and to make
collections of money. The pastors had no longer the right
to leave their place of residence, or to open schools. The
priests, monks, and nuns who had married, were commanded
instantly to separate themselves from their consorts, or to
quit the kingdom with the least possible delay. Thus was
the iron circle which surrounded the Huguenots, tightened
until they should be stifled by it.</p>

<p>The queen-mother held a conference at Bayonne, with the
Duke d’Albe, in the month of June, 1565. This interview
has been celebrated, because, according to the testimony of
several historians, the plot of the Saint Bartholomew massacre
was there laid down. The ferocious envoy of Philip II. told
Catherine that a sovereign could do nothing more damaging
to his interests, or more degrading to his subjects, than to
give them liberty of conscience, and he counselled her to cut
down the highest heads of the Huguenots, for then the rest
might be easily managed. “Ten thousand frogs,” he continued
in his coarse language, “are not worth the head of a
salmon.”</p>

<p>We are assured that the plot was to have been carried out
in 1566, during the session of the assembly of Notables at
Moulins. But Coligny and the other chiefs came well attended,
and the bloody deed was adjourned to a better opportunity.</p>

<p>The court having brought six thousand (Roman) Catholic
soldiers from Switzerland, the Huguenots saw they had to
fear the worst, and the prince of Condé held a council with
the chiefs of his party. The Admiral was of opinion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
they should still have patience, and wait till things had come
to the last extremity. “I see very well,” he said, “how we
may light up the fire, but not where to find water to
quench it.”</p>

<p>His brother D’Andelot thought differently. “If you
wait,” he said, “until we are banished into foreign lands,
bound in prison, pursued by the people, despised by the
soldiers, what will our patience or our past humility have
availed us? What will our innocence profit us? Who will
so much as listen to us? Those have already declared war,
who have thrust in amongst us six thousand foreign soldiers.
If we also give them the advantage of striking the first
blow, our misfortune will be without a remedy.”</p>

<p>The prince of Condé went once more with the admiral to
the queen, to entreat her to be more just to the Reformed.
They were badly received. Seeing that their complaints
were useless, they resolved to follow the example given them
five years before by the duke of Guise, and to seize the young
king, who was then in the castle of Monceaux, in Brie
(September, 1567).</p>

<p>The plot was discovered, and the court fled precipitately
to Meaux. The Chancellor l’Hospital, always favourable to
measures of justice and moderation, proposed to send the
Swiss home, to carry out the Edict of Amboise faithfully, and
promised that on these conditions the Huguenots should lay
down their arms. “<span lang="fr">Eh! Monsieur le Chancelier,</span>” said the
queen, “will you answer that they have no other end than
to serve the king?” “Yes, madame,” answered L’Hospital,
“if I am assured that there is no intention to deceive them.”
But the Cardinal de Lorraine and the Constable were of
opinion that no concession should be made.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was necessary to gain time; for the Swiss
had not yet arrived. Catherine therefore cajoled the chiefs
of the Calvinists by negotiations; she sent the Marshal de
Montmorency to them, as a man of the Third Party. He
was well received. The Reformed repeated to him the cry,
which was uttered in all their complaints: “The free exercise
of our religion!” While this was going on, the Swiss
arrived; the conference was broken off, and the opportunity
lost. A (Roman) Catholic historian of our own time expresses
astonishment at “<em>the credulity of these country gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
who were ready to disperse upon the faith of a simple promise</em>.”
It appears to us, that this remark does as much honour to
the good faith of the Calvinist party, as it does little credit
to that of the (Roman) Catholic court of Charles IX.</p>

<p>After this undertaking, nothing was left but to resort to
the hazard of arms. Condé encamped in the environs of
Paris, with one thousand infantry and fifteen hundred
cavalry. The Constable offered him battle in the plain of
Saint Denis, on the 10th of November, 1567. He had
eighteen thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry, but
they were for the most part recruits of Parisian volunteers.</p>

<p>A crowd of idlers, and ladies dressed as Amazons, wished
to enjoy the spectacle of the fight. Monks distributed beads,
and chanted litanies. The action commenced towards the
end of the day. At the first shock, the Parisians, who were
known by their embroidered dresses and brilliant armour,
gave way. The Constable, with the Swiss and the cavalry,
defended himself vigorously. At the end of two hours, the
Huguenots retreated in good order, and their adversaries
dared not pursue them further than a quarter of a league
from the field of battle.</p>

<p>Anne de Montmorency, covered with wounds, had been
summoned by a Scottish gentleman to surrender. “Dost
thou know me?” the Constable asked. “It is because I
know thee, that I bring thee this,” answered the other, and
fired a pistol at him. Montmorency, the last of the triumvirate,
died of his wound a few days after. He obtained from
Catherine de Medicis nothing but feigned tears, from the
bigoted (Roman) Catholics a cold indifference, and from the
Reformed a well-deserved resentment. The accident of his
birth had placed his fortune too high. In all his great employments
he wanted one quality, for which nothing can
compensate—a breadth of understanding.</p>

<p>A man of sense, the Marshal de Vielleville, spoke, indeed,
truly [to the king] of the affair of Saint Denis. “It is not
your majesty who has gained the battle, and still less the
prince of Condé.” “And who then?” asked Charles IX.
“Sire, it is the king of Spain.”</p>

<p>On the very day following, the Calvinist army presented
itself before the faubourgs of Paris, but no one came out to
encounter them. They then retired on the side of Lorraine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
to meet the auxiliaries, which were led by Jean Casimir, the
son of the Elector Palatine. The two armies united at Pont-à-Mous-son,
on the 11th of January, 1568. Here an event,
probably without example in military annals, happened. The
German Protestants claimed a hundred thousand crowns as
their arrears of pay, and Condé had not two thousand. What
was to be done? To whom apply? It was then that one
army, which had itself received nothing, mulcted itself to
pay another.</p>

<p>The historian Jean de Serres relates this singular incident
in energetic terms: “The Prince and the Admiral influenced
great and small by their example; the ministers in their
sermons moved the men, and the captains prepared their
people. Every one contributed, one from zeal, another from
love; one from fear, another for shame of reproach; they
collected in money, plate, chains and rings of gold, about
eighty thousand francs, and by this voluntary liberality they
subdued the first and pressing avidity of the mercenaries.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The war was rekindled all over France. Montluc recommenced
his ravages in Guienne and Saintonge, and,
after having failed before the walls of La Rochelle, put
almost the whole of the Calvinist population of the island of
Ré to the sword. An army of seven thousand Huguenots
overran Gascony, Quercy, and Languedoc, and traversed the
entire kingdom as far as Orleans. It was called <em>the army
of the Viscounts</em>, because it had for leaders the viscounts
<ins class="corr" id="tn-148" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Montclar, Bruniquel'">
Monclar, Bruniquel</ins>, Caumont, Rapin, and other gentlemen.</p>

<p>The towns of Montauban, Nismes, Castres, Montpellier,
Uzès, remained or fell into the power of the Calvinists, who
were then in a great majority. At Nismes, from the beginning
of the war the Huguenot populace had committed, in
spite of the exhortations of the pastors and notables, a frightful
massacre of seventy-two prisoners. The following day
forty-eight more (Roman) Catholics were slaughtered in the
fields. This crime bore the name of <i lang="fr">Michelade</i>, because it
took place on the day of Saint Michel, 1567.</p>

<p>The prince of Condé commenced his march across Burgundy,
Champagne, Beauce, and began the siege of Chartres,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
one of the granaries of Paris. The affairs of the Huguenots
now assumed a favourable turn. The queen-mother, who
was accustomed to say she could do more with three sheets
of paper and her tongue than the soldiers with their lances,
recommenced negotiations. The chiefs of the Calvinists, who
had learned to their cost the value of Catherine’s word,
wished for guarantees. But the queen had it published in
the army that the Edict of Pacification should be re-established
without interpretations or reservations, that a full
amnesty should be given to all who had had recourse to
arms, and that the chiefs alone refused this equitable arrangement
from ambitious motives.</p>

<p>This trick succeeded. Whole companies of Calvinists,
without the leave of their chiefs, took the road to their
homes; and the prince of Condé, seeing his entire army thus
melting away, signed, on the 20th of March, 1568, the peace
of Longjumeau. It was named “<em>the lame and badly-seated
peace</em>,” because, of the two negotiators of the queen, one was
the lord of <i lang="fr">Malassise</i> and the other was lame. Frenchmen
like to be merry upon everything; but truly there was little
cause for merriment at that moment. “That peace,” says
Mézeray, “left the Huguenots at the mercy of their enemies,
with no other surety than the word of an Italian woman.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_X">X.</h3>
</div>


<p>The treaty of Longjumeau lasted but six months, or rather
it never existed but on paper. Whilst the Calvinists were
sending home their foreign troops, Catherine de Medicis kept
hers. She took possession of the strong places, had the
bridges and passes guarded, and took every measure to crush
the Huguenots.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic pulpits still thundered imprecations
and anathemas against them. “They boldly advanced,” says
the Abbé Anquetil, “those abominable maxims, that they
ought not to keep faith with heretics, and that it is a just,
pious, and useful act, leading to salvation, to massacre them.
The fruits of these discourses were either public riots, or
assassinations, for which no justice could be obtained.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>There is a sort of frightful monotony in these scenes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
murder, which stained peace no less than war with blood.
Lyons, Bourges, Troyes, Auxerre, Issoudun, Rouen, Amiens,
and other towns were strewed with the corpses of Huguenots.
Nearly ten thousand perished in three months. At Orleans
two hundred had been cast into prison. The mob set fire to
the prison, and drove back those who tried to escape, into the
flames: “A part of them were seen,” says Crespin, “joining
hands in the fire, and were heard to call upon the Lord with
a loud voice.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor de l’Hospital made loud complaints of the
impunity accorded to these butchers. He was not listened to;
and seeing that he could no longer usefully serve the state, he
withdrew to his property at Vignay. Catherine de Medicis
gave the seals to Jean de Morvilliers, a creature of the Cardinal
de Lorraine. The Marshal de Montmorency, suspected
of moderation and humanity, was also superseded from his
office as governor of Paris.</p>

<p>Even those sacred rights, which savages would blush to
infringe, were no longer respected. The Baron Philibert de
Rapin, <i lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i> to the prince of Condé, having been
sent to Languedoc to carry out the treaty of peace, was
seized by order of the Parliament of Toulouse, and beheaded
three days afterwards.</p>

<p>Condé, Coligny, and D’Andelot, threatened with ruin and
death, fled to La Rochelle. They left the Château of Noyers
in Burgundy with their wives and children at midnight, on
the 25th August, 1568, and travelled a hundred leagues in
twenty-four hours through bands of enemies.</p>

<p>The queen of Navarre, Jeanne d’Albret, went to join
them with four thousand men. As many more came from
Normandy, the Maine, and Anjou. The most famous captains
of the party hastened thither with their companies,
so that these fugitives of yesterday found themselves at the
head of the strongest army they had yet commanded, and
Coligny repeated the saying of Themistocles: “My friends,
we had perished, if we had not been lost.” Thus commenced
the third religious war.</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis put forth edicts which annulled that
of January; she also forbade the exercise of the pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Reformed religion under pain of death, and ordered all its
ministers to depart from the kingdom in fifteen days. At
the same time the duke of Anjou, the next brother of
Charles IX., and the favourite son of Catherine, afterwards
known as Henry III., was placed at the head of the (Roman)
Catholic army; but although he had twenty-four thousand
infantry and four thousand cavalry under his command, he
dared not offer battle. The very severe winter of 1568 was
passed in marches and countermarches, without any decisive
event taking place.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March following, the two armies met at
Jarnac. It was less a battle than a surprise. The different
bodies of the Calvinists fell into line successively, and were
cut to pieces one after the other. The prince of Condé performed
prodigies of valour; but, being thrown from his
horse, and carrying his arm in a sling from the beginning of
the affair, he surrendered to a (Roman) Catholic gentleman.
At the same <ins class="corr" id="tn-151" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'instant Montesquiou'">
instant Montesquieu</ins>, one of the officers of the
duke of Anjou, coming up behind him, fired a pistol at his
head. “This action, which might have passed in the affray for
a splendid feat of arms,” says Mézeray, “being done in cold
blood, appeared to all good men as an execrable parricide.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The duke of Anjou caused the corpse of Condé to be carried
upon an ass, whilst he himself joined in the infamous jestings
of the soldiers, and wanted to have a triumphal column raised
on the spot where the prince had been assassinated. He
acted as a worthy son of Catherine.</p>

<p>The news of the death of Condé and the victory of Jarnac,
raised transports of joy amongst the (Roman) Catholics, and
Charles IX. sent to the pope the standards that had been
taken from the Huguenots.</p>

<p>Michel Ghisleri then occupied the pontifical throne under
the name of Pius V. He had entered a convent of Dominicans
when only fifteen years of age, and had afterwards
been intrusted with the office of Inquisitor-General in the
Milanais, whence he had been expelled on account of his implacable
severity. He only knew Luther under the name of
“the ferocious beast” (<i lang="it">bellua</i>), and saw in heresy the summary
of every crime. His letters were printed at Antwerp in 1640,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and are a standing monument of infuriate madness against
heretics. Pius V. wrote to Charles IX. to be deaf to every
prayer, to stifle every tie of blood or affection, and to extirpate
the roots of heresy to the very last fibres. He cited
the example of Saul slaying the Amalekites, and represented
every feeling of clemency as a snare of the devil. At such
moral aberrations it is impossible to feel anger; we are rather
moved by a feeling of deep and sad compassion.</p>

<p>Pius V. and Charles IX. had been too precipitate in regarding
the position of the Huguenots as desperate. Coligny
still remained to them. He was seconded by Jeanne d’Albret,
who, holding in her hand her son, Henry of Béarn, then
fifteen years of age, and her nephew Henry, son of the prince
of Condé, came to Saintes to “<em>offer to the cause</em>,”—an expression
in vogue among the Calvinists—and prayed to God never
to suffer them to swerve from their duty. The young
Béarnais was proclaimed <i lang="it">generalissimo</i> and <em>protector</em> of the
churches. “I swear,” said he, “to defend the religion, and
to persevere in the common cause, until either death or victory
has restored to us the liberty we seek.”</p>

<p>On the 23rd June, 1569, Coligny gained the advantage in
the fight of the Roche-Abeille; but he lost many of his men
at the siege of Poitiers, which he had been forced to undertake
at the instance of the gentlemen of the province. On
the 3rd of October following, he was beaten at Moncontour.
The German soldiers had mutinied, and the Admiral could
not avoid a conflict with the enemy, as he had intended.
The battle lasted but three-quarters of an hour, and the disaster
was terrible. Out of twenty-five thousand soldiers,
only six or eight thousand remained under his standard.
Entire companies had been put to the sword. The lansquenets
cried for mercy, saying, “<em>I am a good Papist! I am a
good Papist!</em>” but no one was spared.</p>

<p>Coligny received three wounds at the commencement of
the action, and the blood which flowed under his visor was
nigh choking him. He had to be carried off the field. In
the evening, when some officers proposed to embark, he
roused their courage by his calm and decisive words. Never
was Coligny so great as in misfortune; he had always calculated
the consequences beforehand.</p>

<p>Another trait of his character deserves to be recorded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
“As the Admiral was carried in a litter,” says Agrippa
D’Aubigné, “Lestrange, an old gentleman, and one of his
principal councillors, also wounded and borne in a similar
equipage, had it brought up in front of the other at a point
where the road widened, and then putting his head out of
the curtain, he looked intently upon his chief, and parted from
him with tears in his eyes, with these words: ‘<em>God is very
good</em>.’ They then bade each other farewell, united in thought,
but unable to say more. This great captain confessed to his
intimate friends that this little word from such a friend had
raised him up, and turned him into the path of good thoughts
and firm resolutions for the future.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Every misfortune seemed to fall at once upon Coligny.
He had lost his brother D’Andelot. The Parliament of
Paris had just declared him guilty of <i lang="fr">lèse-majesté</i>, a traitor
and a felon, inviting any one to attack him, with a promise
of fifty thousand crowns to any one who should deliver him
up, dead or alive; in fact, he had been exposed to several attempts
at assassination. Bands of miscreants had burned
his château and devastated his domains. Lastly, as if to
overwhelm him with a final blow, Pius V. had addressed letters
to the king and queen-mother, in which he described
him as “<em>a detestable, infamous, and execrable man, if indeed
he deserved the name of man!</em>”</p>

<p>Behold, then, this great unfortunate, outlawed by the
government of his country, and, in a manner, by the human
and divine law, by the chief of (Roman) Catholicity, covered
with wounds, despoiled of all he possessed, with mutinied
mercenaries, an army struck down by defeat, abandoned by
many of his friends, blamed by a great number, and having
to contend against adversaries without mercy and without
faith! Behold him thus, and then read this letter, so pious
and so calm, which he wrote to his children on the 16th of
October, 1569, thirteen days after the disaster of Moncontour:
it is one of the most beautiful pages of the history of
humanity:—</p>

<p>“We must not count upon what is called property, but
rather place our hope elsewhere than on earth, and acquire
other means than those which we see with our eyes, or touch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
with our hands. We must follow Jesus Christ, our Chief,
who has gone before us. Men have taken from us all they
can; if such is always the will of God, we shall be happy,
and our condition good, since this loss has happened to us
through no injury that has been done to those who caused
it, but simply for the hatred borne to me, because it has
pleased God to make use of me to help His Church.... For
the present, it is enough for me to admonish and conjure you,
in the name of God, to persevere with courage in the practice
of virtue.”</p>

<p>Coligny did not confine himself to writing: he collected
together another army. At his voice, from every mountain
of Béarn, <ins class="corr" id="tn-154" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of Cevannes, of'">
of Cevennes, of</ins> Dauphiné, of Vivarais, of the
county of Foix, there came down intrepid gentlemen, and warlike
peasants, who promised to defend their faith and their
liberty to the death. He traversed the half of France,
passed the Loire, defeated the (Roman) Catholics near
Arnay-le-Duc, and marched towards Paris, saying, “The
Parisians would incline to peace when they found the war at
their gates.”</p>

<p>The court was seized as much with astonishment as with fear,
at finding Coligny at the head of a third army, as numerous
as those he had lost, and better disciplined. It once more
offered conditions of peace, and a treaty was signed at St.
Germain-en-Laye, on the 8th of August, 1570. It was more
favourable to the Reformed than the preceding ones. It
gave them liberty of worship in all the places which were in
their possession; in addition, two towns for every province
for the celebration of service, an amnesty for the past, equal
right of admission to public offices, permission to reside in
any part of the kingdom without being molested on account
of religion, and four hostage-towns,—La Rochelle, La Charité,
Cognac, and Montauban.</p>

<p>The queen Catherine showed herself generous. The
(Roman) Catholic historian Davila, who well knew the
secrets of this court, assures us that she was agreed with the
Cardinal de Lorraine and the duke of Anjou about the project
of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew. “It was determined,”
he says, “to return to the project already formed so
many times, and so often abandoned, to free the country of
foreign troops, and then to employ artifices to get rid of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
chiefs, in the hope that the party would yield of itself, as
soon as they saw themselves deprived of this support.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Admiral, who suspected nothing, signed the peace
with joy. “Rather than again fall back into these disorders,”
he said, “I would die a thousand deaths, and be dragged
through the streets of Paris.” And so, in effect, he was;
but the disorders, far from ceasing, recommenced with fury,
and lasted twenty-five years.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XI">XI.</h3>
</div>


<p>This is the proper place to point out the changes, which
had been effected since the wars of religion had begun, both
in the position and character of the Reformed, and in their
relations with the (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>Although still numerous on the south of the Loire, the
Reformed had lost much ground. Paris, henceforth, belonged
exclusively to the Romish church. Picardy, Normandy,
Orleanais, Champagne, all the north, and a considerable portion
of the centre of France, now possessed only scattered
and timid flocks. The boldest had perished; the least
courageous had returned to the dominant communion. A
crowd of those who filled public offices, gentlemen and rich
citizens, had done the same. The women, also, in order to
escape from the brutal violence to which they were subjected,
had taken refuge in great number in (Roman) Catholicism,
as the last asylum for their chastity.</p>

<p>Another difference, equally important, must be related.
At the States-General of Orleans, and at the conference of
Poissy, the Reformed might hope to draw the masses to
themselves, the Parliaments, even royalty itself; in 1570
they could do so no longer. Every one had clearly chosen
his side for the one church or for the other; opinions had
become sharply defined and matured; the floating population
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Before the wars, proselytism was wholesale; it embraced
towns and entire provinces; afterwards, proselytes were rare,
being only made one by one, and with infinite trouble: so
many were the corpses piled up between the two communions!
So many were the bitter enmities and cruel remembrances
around the two camps, forbidding communication!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The destiny of the Reformed in France was truly strange
and deplorable. Had they not taken arms, they would probably
have been exterminated like the Albigeois. In taking
up arms, they kindled the fiercest hatred, and dug a pit,
which no longer permitted the (Roman) Catholics to approach
them.</p>

<p>But even these calamities might have become the source
of good for both communions. The Reformed had been instructed
by misfortunes. They now understood and proclaimed
that two religions might exist in the same state.
Resigned to being only a minority, they cited in their writings
the arrangements concluded between the rival churches in
Germany. They went so far as to invoke the toleration of the
Roman pontiff for the Jews, and of the Turks for the Christians.
They had renounced the pretension to reign; they
only asked for the right to live, and (Roman) Catholicism
might have given them that, without putting its ancient
prerogatives in danger.</p>

<p>A respected modern historian says upon this subject:
“The experience of the edicts of toleration during the peace,
and of the mutual efforts of the two parties during the war,
had extinguished in them (the Reformed) many illusions as
to their strength. They could no longer believe that they
were the more numerous, and that fear alone held the masses
in apparent conformity with the Romish church. They
had, on the contrary, become convinced, that progressive
opinions, which called for the exercise of the understanding
and of judgment, could only be dominant among the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of
the nation.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore a grave error to advance either religious or
political necessity in justification of the massacre of Saint
Bartholomew. Rome had no longer anything to fear for her
supremacy, nor the crown for the maintenance of its political
power. It was fanaticism, it was the resentment of the past
struggles, which led to the crushing of the minority in 1572:
it was no state reason.</p>

<p>The piety and the manners of the Reformed had also
suffered much from the misfortunes of the time. Without
having fallen into the hideous corruption of the court of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Catherine, and without giving themselves up to the irregularities,
which defiled the (Roman) Catholic clergy, they had lost
much of their fervid and simple faith, and of the pious severity
of conduct of their earlier years. In surrendering themselves
to the spirit of party, religion had been degraded; they
adhered, perhaps, the more strongly to their sect; they
belonged less to Christianity.</p>

<p>Some Huguenots, who had been incessantly under arms
for eight years, could not again settle quietly under their
own roofs. They only lived, they only breathed in freedom,
in the tumult of camps and the madness of battles. For
this reason, Coligny wished to employ them in the war of Brabant.
Others, who had only assumed the trade of the soldier
for the moment, had learned from it less of brotherly love,
and more of the thirst for revenge. Avarice and ambition
had returned with the rest. “The consciences of several,”
says a contemporary, “began to shake, and there were few
who evinced a strong affection for religion; both great and
small already thought much of the world, and built many
castles in the air.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The pastors applied themselves to cure these wounds by
means of the pious men of their consistories and synods; unhappily
the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, and the fresh
wars which it excited, left them but little leisure for so great
a work.</p>

<p>We have made no mention of the national synods which
were convoked after that of 1559, because their acts had no
reference to general affairs, and because they were exclusively
directed to points of discipline or to private matters, which
have no interest for the present time. The second national
synod was held at Poitiers, in 1561; the third at Orleans, in
1562; the fourth at Lyons, in 1563; the fifth at Paris, in
1565; the sixth at Verteuil, in 1567. These assemblies
were properly severe concerning the preservation of the faith
and good order of their flocks.</p>

<p>The seventh national synod, held at La Rochelle, in April,
1571, under the presidency of Theodore de Bèze, was the
first of those great assemblies which took place with the full
consent of the king. It deserves to be distinguished from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the rest from its importance and the extraordinary solemnity,
by which it was surrounded. The queen of Navarre, the
princes Henry of Béarn and Henry of Condé, the <ins class="corr" id="tn-158" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Admiral de Colingy'">
Admiral de Coligny</ins>, and the Count Louis of Nassau, were present,
and several of these distinguished personages took a direct
part in the deliberation in their capacity as deputies of the
churches.</p>

<p>The confession of faith of 1559 was then sanctioned and
reduced to a uniform text: “Inasmuch as our confession of
faith is printed in different ways,” said the members of the
assembly, “the synod declares that that is the only true one
which was drawn up at the first national synod.” It was
determined to make three copies on parchment, of which one
should be kept at La Rochelle, the second in Béarn, and the
third at Geneva, after being signed by the members, ecclesiastic
and lay, of the synod. The two copies of Béarn and
La Rochelle were lost during the religious wars.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XII">XII.</h3>
</div>


<p>An illustrious magistrate of the sixteenth century said, in
speaking of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew: “Let it be
blotted out from the memory of man!” This wish has not
been fulfilled, nor should it ever be; the great crimes of
mankind are great lessons!</p>

<p>So far from this event being forgotten, a vast library
might be filled with the books which have been written upon
it. Authors of every nation—French, Italian, English, German—have
devoted long and patient research to this subject.
Every word has been weighed, every act commented on;
and they have striven to assign to each person his due share
of responsibility.</p>

<p>These are questions, which in our day are exhausted in
the estimation of the enlightened and honest men of every
opinion. Thus no one would now dare to maintain the fable
of a plot by Coligny against the king’s life. The thesis of
the Abbé de Caveyrac upon <em>salutary rigours</em>, will not be reproduced.
The premeditation of the massacre can be no
longer seriously denied. The (Roman) Catholic French historians,
De Thou, Mézeray, Péréfixe, Maimbourg, all admit it;
the Italian historians, Davila, Capilupi, Adriani, Catena,
these confidants of Catherine de Medicis, or of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
conclave, do more; they admire and extol the premeditation,
and see in it a marvellous effect of the blessing of
heaven. These, then, are settled points.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>But there is another question, which, as it concerns the
honour of the French name, as well as the rights of truth,
must be considered. Who were the first, and the real authors
of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew? We make answer,
from researches, of which we will here give a short analysis.</p>

<p>The popes and the king of Spain, who never ceased to demand
by their legates, their ambassadors, their public and
secret agents, the extermination of the chiefs of the Huguenot
party;</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis, the niece of Clement VII., the woman
of Florence, who had been nurtured in the precepts of Machiavel;</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Lorraine, doubly a foreigner by his birth,
and in his quality of prince of the Roman church;</p>

<p>His nephew, Henry of Guise, a Lorraine, a young man
of twenty-two, who sought to persuade himself that the
Admiral was guilty of the death of his father, in order to incite
himself to assassinate him, and to become, after his death,
the first person in the state;</p>

<p>Albert de Gondi, the Florentine, whom we have already
named, who cited the murder of the duke of Orleans, by the
duke of Burgundy, as an example to Charles IX., and said
it was necessary not to do things by halves, but to kill all,
even the young Bourbon princes, the sin being as great for
a small as for a great crime;</p>

<p>René Birago, or de Birague, a Milanese adventurer, whom
Francis I. had brought to France; he had risen by climbing
to the highest offices of the magistracy, and received a cardinal’s
hat, as a reward for the part he took in the massacre
of Saint Bartholomew. It was this Birago, who went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
about repeating the atrocious phrase, that to terminate the
religious wars “<em>cooks were needed more them soldiers</em>;”</p>

<p>Lastly, Louis de Gonzague, a native of Mantua, and duke
of Nevers, a skilful courtier, an indifferent captain, and one
of the most eager of his day in promoting assassinations.</p>

<p>Up to this point there was not a single Frenchman [connected
with the plot]. But besides Spain and the Papacy,
there were two Lorraines, three Italian men, and one Italian
woman<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> [engaged in it]. Albert de Gondi was the most intimate
of the confidants of Catherine de Medicis. The duke
of Guise, Birago, and Louis de Gonzague, formed a second
secret council, which decided everything.</p>

<p>There remains, however, three Frenchmen [to be named]:
the Marshal de Tavannes, the duke of Anjou, and Charles IX.
These alone, with the Lorraines and the Italians, had any
influence in the deliberations; the other Frenchmen were
but creatures and tools.</p>

<p>The Marshal de Tavannes authorized the crime and helped
in its consummation; he even showed himself, after the
affair was begun, extremely violent; but in the councils he
had spoken with more moderation than his accomplices, and
had rejected the proposal to kill the two Bourbon princes.</p>

<p>The duke of Anjou, then in his twentieth year, had been
brought up, like his brother, by Gondi, who had taught him
to violate faith and to feast himself with spectacles of blood.
He was already given up to those unbridled debaucheries,
and to those ignoble superstitions, which made him a modern
Heliogabalus, and the most abject prince ever seen upon the
throne of France. “As for me,” said Charles IX. to Coligny,
“I am a Frenchman and king of the French; my brother,
the duke of Anjou, speaks only with his head, his eyes, and
his shoulders; he is an Italian.”</p>

<p>Charles IX. was the last [to give his adhesion]. The execration
of the human race has fallen upon his head, because
he held the sceptre on the fatal day, and because, as soon as
he smelt the odour of blood, he was maddened to become the
executioner of his subjects. But he was not the most guilty.
He had moments of candour and generosity; he alone hesitated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and was the only one of this infamous court who felt
the pangs of remorse.</p>

<p>“Will there be no pity,” asks M. de Châteaubriand in his
<cite lang="fr">Etudes historiques</cite>, “for this monarch of twenty-three years
of age, born with good talents, with a taste for literature
and the arts, a character naturally generous, whom a detestable
mother had delighted to deprave by all the abuses of
debauchery and power?” Yes, there will be pity for him,
even amongst those Huguenots whose fathers he caused to
be slaughtered, and with a pious hand they will wipe off the
blood which covers his face, to discover in it something that
is human.</p>

<p>These were the real authors of the Saint Bartholomew massacre,
and this is the manner in which they prepared and
accomplished it.</p>

<p>The court saw with displeasure that the chiefs of the Reformed,
Jeanne d’Albret, Henry of Bourbon, Henry of Condé,
Coligny, Larochefoucauld, Lanoue, Briquemant, and Cavagnes,
had retired to La Rochelle, or to their provinces. It was
necessary to draw them out, in order to get them into their
power. Men of the third party were sent to them, who,
without raising their distrust, might induce them to approach
nearer to Paris. The Calvinist deputies positively went to
court, where they experienced the most favourable reception.
Charles IX. behaved not only as a king, who forgets and
pardons, but as a prince who was anxious to gratify his discontented
subjects. He gave much and promised more; he
especially heaped favours upon Téligny, son-in-law of the
Admiral, a young man of frank and amiable character, who
almost thought that he had found a friend in his master.</p>

<p>However, these chiefs of the second rank were not enough;
those of the first rank were necessary, and in order to succeed,
the marriage of Margaret of Valois, the sister of Charles IX.,
with Henry of Béarn was brought forward, a brilliant alliance
for the poor house of Navarre, but one which dazzled Jeanne
d’Albret but little, because she balanced the vices of the
Valois against their fortune. “I would rather,” she said,
“descend to be the most humble maiden of France, than sacrifice
my soul and that of my son to grandeur.”</p>

<p>The envoys of the court set before her and the chiefs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
the party, considerations of another kind. They represented
that this marriage would be the best guarantee of a solid
peace between the two religions. Coligny allowed himself to be
deceived,—he came to believe, in the simplicity of his great
heart, that the entire kingdom would be united at the same
time as the royal family. Charles IX. indeed declared that
he married his sister not only to the prince of Navarre, but
to the whole party. “It will be,” he said, “the strongest
and the closest bond of peace between my subjects, and a
sure testimony of my good-will towards those of the religion.”</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Albret dared resist no longer, she went to Blois
in the month of May, 1572, leaving her son behind her, out
of a lingering feeling of distrust. “On the day of her arrival,”
says L’Estoile, “the king and the queen-mother caressed her
with much [apparent tenderness], especially the king, who
called her his great-aunt, his all, his best-beloved, and never
left her side, and entertained her with so much honour and
respect, that every one was astonished.” In the evening, on
retiring, he said to the queen his mother, laughing, “And
now, madam, what do you say, do I not play my part well?”
“Yes,” she answered, “very well; but nothing is well which
is not kept up.” “Leave me alone,” said the king, “and you
shall see how I will put the bit on them.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Jeanne d’Albret set out on her journey for Paris on the
15th May. On the 4th June she fell ill; on the 9th she was
dead. Had she been poisoned? Many believed so. It was
said that a Florentine perfumer, Master René, known by the
name of the queen’s poisoner, had sold her some poisoned
gloves.</p>

<p>She showed in her last days the same consistent piety,
which had adorned her life. She uttered neither complaints
nor murmurs in the most cruel accessions of pain; a faith
resigned and serene shone through all her sufferings. Her
tranquil heroism astonished that court, when in dying they
could laugh, but knew not how peacefully to collect themselves
before God. She had no regret for her life, but in
reflecting on the youth of her son and of her daughter
Catherine. “In any case,” she said, “my trust is that God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
will be to them a father and protector, as He has been to me
in my greatest afflictions; I commit them to His Providence
to provide for them.” She died at the age of forty-four.</p>

<p>The Admiral Coligny had already gone to court in the
autumn of 1571; he returned in July, 1572, in spite of the
warnings of many of his friends. “I trust,” he answered
them, “to the sincerity and the oath of his majesty.”</p>

<p>In his first interview, Coligny knelt before the king.
Charles IX. raised him up, called him his father, and embracing
the illustrious old man thrice, said to him, “We
have got you now; you shall not escape when you wish;
this is the happiest day of my life.”</p>

<p>He opened his councils to the Admiral, and seemed to
listen to him with the deference of a son. Coligny laid
before him the political plans which had long occupied his
thoughts, and which were afterwards adopted by Henry IV.
and Cardinal Richelieu—humiliation of the house of Spain; aid
to the insurgents of the Low Countries; alliance with the Protestant
princes of the empire and of Sweden, in order to become
the arbiter of peace and war in Europe. The conquest
of the Low Countries was then easy; for the Belgians, out
of hatred to Philip II. and the duke of Alba, would have
joyfully offered to become an integrant part of the kingdom.
If the Admiral’s plan had been followed, France from the
sixteenth century would have become the first power in the
world, and the entire pages of modern history would have
been changed. But the popes, the queen-mother, her advisers,
and the Guises prevented it, in spite of Charles IX.,
who felt at last the instinct of national honour.</p>

<p>The marriage of Margaret of Valois with Henry of Béarn,
who had just taken the title of king of Navarre, was celebrated
on the 18th August, 1572, and four days were spent
in games, festivals, masquerades, and ballets.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 22nd August, Coligny was returning from
the Louvre, accompanied by twelve or fifteen gentlemen.
He was walking slowly, being engaged in reading a petition,
when passing in front of the cloister of Saint Germain, he
was struck by three balls shot from an arquebuse, which
shattered the forefinger of his left hand, and wounded his
left arm. The door of the house whence the arquebuse had
been fired, was burst open, but only a laquais and a female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
servant were found. The murderer had had time to escape:
it was Maurevel, formerly a page of the dukes of Guise, and
one of their intimates; “<em>the slayer on the king’s wages, the common
assassin</em>,” as he is styled by the historians of the epoch.</p>

<p>The surgeon Ambrois Paré examined the Admiral’s wound.
It was feared that the copper balls had been poisoned, and
Coligny believed he was approaching his last hour. “My
friends,” he said, “why do you weep? as for me, I hold myself
happy to have received these wounds for the cause of
God; pray to Him to strengthen me.”</p>

<p>The news of the crime was spread in a moment throughout
Paris, and excited the greatest agitation. The sheriffs
(<i lang="fr">échevins</i>) ordered the captains of the militia to assemble
their companies, and to guard the Hôtel de Ville. The king
was playing at tennis when he heard of the event, and angrily
throwing down his racket, exclaimed, “Shall I never
have any peace? Must I witness fresh troubles every day?”
This first utterance of his conscience tends to clear his
memory; the assassination was the work of the duke of
Guise, supported by Catherine and her confidants; it had
not been ordered by Charles IX.</p>

<p>The Calvinists gathered in consternation at the dwelling
of the Admiral, and held counsel together. They wished to
remove him instantly from Paris, but the physicians would
not permit it.</p>

<p>The marshals Damville and De Cossé, men of the third party,
also came to offer their services to the Admiral. “I have
no other regret for what has happened to me,” he said, “but
that of being deprived of the opportunity of showing the
king the affection I bear to his service. I could have wished,”
he added, “to converse a while with the king upon things of
great moment for him to know, and which I think there is
no one who would dare to tell him.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Charles IX. came with the queen-mother,
the duke of Anjou, and other personages of the court, to see
him. The occurrences at this interview are variously related.
Coligny spoke to the king concerning the war of the Low
Countries, and the Edict of Pacification; then he discoursed
with him for some minutes, in a low voice. Charles IX. and
his mother wished to see the ball, which had been extracted
from the wound. “You bear the wound,” said the king,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
“and I the perpetual pain; but, by God’s death, I will take
such terrible revenge, that it shall never be forgotten!”</p>

<p>Was his indignation sincere? From the manner in which
he addressed the duke Henry of Guise, and from the order
given him to quit the court without delay, it may be supposed
to have been so. But Catherine and the duke of Anjou
represented to the king that the accusation of the murder
of the Admiral would certainly ascend to him, notwithstanding
anything he might do; that civil war was about to be
renewed; and that it was better to fight the battle in Paris,
where all the chiefs were assembled, than to encounter the
risk of a new campaign. “Well,” said Charles IX., in a
fit of frenzy, “since you think the Admiral must be killed,
I am willing; but it must be with all the Huguenots, so
that there be not one left to reproach me.”</p>

<p>The day of Saturday was spent in preparations, and secret
councils. The duke of Guise, who had speedily returned
after feigning to depart, arranged matters with the sheriffs,
the captains of the <i lang="fr">quartiers</i>, and the Swiss. “Let every
good Catholic,” he said to them, “tie a strip of white linen
round his arm, and wear a white cross in his hat.”</p>

<p>The hour drew nigh. Catherine declared to Charles IX.
that it was too late to go back; that the moment had come
to lop off the gangrened limbs; and, recurring to the language
of her cradle, as will happen under the dominion of
powerful emotions: “<i lang="it">E pietà</i>,” she said, “<i lang="it">lor ser crudele, e
crudeltà lor ser pietoso</i> (it is pity to be cruel to them, and it
would be cruelty to show them pity).”</p>

<p>Charles still hesitated; a cold sweat stood upon his forehead.
His mother struck a blow upon the point, on which
he was most sensitive. She asked if by his irresolution he
would have his courage called in question. The king was
indignant at the thought of a suspicion of cowardice. He
rose, and cried out: “Well, begin!” It was then half-past
one in the morning.</p>

<p>In the king’s chamber there were now only Catherine,
Charles IX., and the duke of Anjou. All three preserved a
sullen silence. The report of the first pistol was heard.
Charles started, and sent word to the duke of Guise to precipitate
nothing. It was too late. The queen-mother, distrusting
the hesitation of her son, had commanded that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
hour for the signal should be anticipated. The great bell of
Saint Germain l’Auxerrois began to toll between two and
three in the morning of Sunday, the 24th of August. At
the sound of the tocsin, armed men rushed out from every
door, shouting, “For God and the King!”</p>

<p>The duke of Guise, accompanied by his uncle, the Duke
d’Aumale, the Chevalier d’Angoulême, and three hundred
soldiers, hastened to the dwelling of the Admiral. They
knocked at the first gate in the king’s name. A gentleman
opened it: he fell stabbed. The inner gate was then burst
in. At the noise of firing Coligny and all his people got up.
They attempted to barricade the entry to the apartments;
but this feeble rampart crumbled before the onset of the
aggressors.</p>

<p>The Admiral had invited his minister Merlin to pray with
him. A servant hurried to him terror-stricken: “Sir,” cried
he, “the house is broken into, and there are no means of
resistance.” “I have long been prepared to die,” answered
Coligny. “As for you, save yourselves if you can; for you
cannot secure my life. I commend my soul to the mercy
of God.”</p>

<p>All reached the upper part of the house, except Nicolas
Muss, his German interpreter. Coligny rested against the
wall; his wound prevented him from standing upright.
The first who entered the room was a Lorraine, or German,
named <em>Behem</em>, <em>Besme</em>, a servant of the duke of Guise. “Are
you not the Admiral?” he demanded. “Yes, I am,” replied
Coligny; and looking without discomposure upon the naked
sword of the assassin, [he added]: “Young man, you
ought to consider my age and my infirmity; but you will
not make my life shorter.” Besme plunged his sword into
his breast, and gave him a second blow upon the head. The
others finished the murder with their daggers.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Guise was waiting impatiently in the courtyard. “<em>Besme</em>,
hast thou done it?” [he shouted]. “It is done, my lord,” [was
the reply given]. <span lang="fr">Monsieur le Chevalier</span> would not believe
it unless he saw it with his eyes; “Throw him out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
window,” [was, therefore, the command]. <em>Besme</em> and one of
his companions lifted up the body of the Admiral, who
still breathing, clutched the window-frame. They flung him
into the courtyard. The duke of Guise, wiping off the blood
from his face with a handkerchief, said: “I know him, it
is he;” and kicking the dead body with his foot, he hastened
into the street, exclaiming: “Courage, comrades; we have
begun well—now for the rest; the king commands it.”</p>

<p>Sixteen years and four months afterwards, on the 23rd of
December, 1588, in the castle of Blois, the corpse of this
same Henry of Guise was lying before Henry III., who, in
like manner, kicked it in the face. Sovereign justice of God!</p>

<p>Coligny was fifty-five years and a half old. Since the
peace of 1570, he every morning and evening read the sermons
of Calvin upon the book of Job, saying that this history
was his help and consolation in all his troubles. He
also spent several hours of the day in writing his memoirs.
These papers having been brought to the council after the
massacre of Saint Bartholomew, were burned by the king’s
order, lest they might increase regret for his death.</p>

<p>Some time after this event, when the English ambassador
expressed his grief for the murder of Coligny, Catherine
made answer to him: “Do you know that the Admiral
recommended the king, as a matter of the last importance,
to keep under the king of Spain, and also your mistress
(Queen Elizabeth), as much as possible?” “Very true, madam,”
replied the ambassador; “he was a bad Englishman,
but a good Frenchman.”</p>

<p>Let us also cite a saying of Montesquieu: “The Admiral
Coligny was assassinated, having only had the glory of the
state at heart.”</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XIII">XIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>We are willing, whilst fulfilling our task, to abridge as far
as possible the details of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew.</p>

<p>When the sun of the 24th of August rose upon Paris, all
was tumult, disorder, and carnage; rivers of blood flowed
in the streets; corpses of men, women, and children blocked
up the doorways; on all sides groans, blasphemies, death-cries,
and imprecations, were heard; ruffians by thousands insulted
their victims before butchering them, and then loaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
themselves with the spoils; the poniard, the pike, the knife,
the sword, the arquebuse, every weapon of the soldier and
the brigand, were brought into the service of this execrable
slaughter; and the vile populace running after the murderers,
finished the Huguenots, by mutilating them and dragging
them in the mire, by a cord round the neck, to have their
share also in this feast of cannibals.</p>

<p>At the Louvre, the Huguenots, brought up one after another
between a double line of halberts, fell bleeding before
they reached the end; and the ladies of the court, well
worthy to be the mothers, the wives, and the sisters of assassins,
came to gloat over the bodies of the victims.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that of so many brave men, who
had a thousand times faced death on the field of battle, there
was but one, Taverny, who sought to defend himself; and
even he was a lawyer. The rest presented their throats to
the poniard like women. A crime so monstrous overwhelmed
their minds, and paralyzed their hands; and before
they could recover themselves, they were no more.</p>

<p>Some, however, who lived on the other side of the Seine,
in the faubourgs Saint Germain, Montgomery, Rohan, Ségur,
and La Ferrière, had time to comprehend their position
and to escape. It was then that the king, maddened with
fury, seized an arquebuse and fired at Frenchmen. Two
hundred and twenty-seven years afterwards, Mirabeau picked
the arquebuse of Charles IX. out of the dust of centuries,
to turn it against the throne of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>On the same Sunday morning, the king sent for Henry
of Navarre and Henry of Condé. He said to them in a
ferocious tone: “<em>The mass, death, or the Bastille</em>.” After
some resistance, the princes consented to make profession of
the Romish faith; but neither the court nor the people believed
in the sincerity of their abjuration.</p>

<p>The massacre lasted four days. It was necessary to clothe
it with a pretext before France and Europe. At first it was
endeavoured to throw the burthen upon the Guises, but they
refused [to bear it]. Next a pretended conspiracy of the Huguenots
against Charles IX. and his family was invented.
There were tergiversations of every kind, fabrications, which
could not be maintained for an hour, confessions, which were
retracted on the following day, orders and counter-orders to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the governors in the provinces: a miserable play of the
actors after the tragic scene.</p>

<p>On Thursday, when the blood of the victims deluged the
streets of Paris, the clergy celebrated an extraordinary jubilee,
and made a general procession. They even determined
to consecrate an annual feast to a triumph so glorious; and
whilst the (Roman) Catholic pulpits re-echoed with thanksgivings,
a medal was struck with this legend: “<em>Piety has
awakened Justice!</em>” The massacre of Saint Bartholomew
was renewed in the provinces, and horrible to say, it lasted
more than six weeks.</p>

<p>We would collect with a religious care the names of those
governors who refused to imbrue their hands in these massacres.
The Viscount d’Orte, at Bayonne; the Count de
Tende, in Dauphiné; Saint Héran, in Auvergne; Chabot
Charny and the President Jeannin, at Dijon; La Guiche,
at Mâçon; de Rieux, at Narbonne; Matignon, at Alençon;
Villars, at Nismes; the Count de Carce, in Provence; and
the Montmorencys in their demesnes and governments.</p>

<p>We delight also, to be able to inscribe in this list the name
of a priest, Jean Hennuyer, bishop of Lisieux. When the
lieutenant of the king imparted to him the order for the
massacre of the Huguenots, he answered: “No, no, sir, I
oppose, and will always oppose the execution of such an
order. I am the pastor of Lisieux, and these people, whom
you command me to slaughter, are my flock. Although they
have at present strayed, having quitted the pasture which
Jesus Christ, the Sovereign Shepherd, has confided to my
care, they may still come back. I do not see in the Gospel
that the shepherd can permit the blood of his sheep to be
shed; on the contrary, I find there, that he is bound to
give his blood and his life for them.” Upon this the governor
asked him for his own acquittance for a refusal in
writing, and this the bishop Hennuyer gave him.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The blow fell upon the provinces with a variable force.
In those where the Reformed were few in number, as in
Brittany, Picardy, Champagne and Burgundy, no great excesses
were committed. In certain cantons of the provinces,
on the contrary, where they were very numerous, as in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Saintonge, and in Lower Languedoc, they did not dare to
attack them. It is important also to observe, that in general,
Saint Bartholomew’s day was nowhere so kept, but in
the towns. This explains why so many Calvinists escaped
death.</p>

<p>The faithful of Meaux were butchered in the prisons
during several days, and the sword being too slow, iron
hammers were employed. Four hundred houses, in the most
handsome quarter of the town, were pillaged and devastated.</p>

<p>At Troyes, the executioner had more humanity than the
governor, who gave him the command to massacre the prisoners.
“It is against my duty,” said he, “for I have not
learned to execute any one without a sentence of condemnation
being first passed.” There were other executioners,
who, finding their hearts fail them in the midst of the
butchery, sent for wine to strengthen them for their work.</p>

<p>At Orleans, where there still remained three thousand
Calvinists, men on horseback cried throughout the streets:
“Courage, friends, kill all, and then you shall pillage their
goods.” The most ruffianly were those who had abjured in
the last wars; they parodied the psalms, whilst they immolated
those whose faith they had forsworn.</p>

<p>At Rouen, many Huguenots took to flight; the rest were
cast into prison. The massacre began only on the 17th September,
and lasted four days. The prisoners were called
over by their names, from a list given to the murderers.
There perished, according to the relation of Crespin, near
six hundred persons.</p>

<p>At Toulouse, the events of Paris were made known on
Sunday, the 31st August. The gates of the town were instantly
closed, and the Reformed, who had gone to celebrate
their worship at the village of Castanet, were only admitted
one by one, by little posterns. They were taken to the
prisons and the convents. There they remained a month.
It was not till the 3rd October that they were executed, by
order of the chief president Dafis. Three hundred perished,
amongst whom were five councillors, who after they were
killed, were hanged in their robes on the great elm, which
stood before the court of the palace.</p>

<p>The massacre of Bordeaux was delayed like that of
Toulouse, and during these hesitations, a Jesuit named Augier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
declaimed every day from his pulpit against the pusillanimity
of the governor. At length, companies of assassins were
organized: they had the name of “<em>the red</em>, or <em>cardinal band</em>,”
bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The towns of Bourges, Angers, and many others, witnessed
similar scenes. But these were trifling by the side of the
massacres of Lyons: here there was a second Saint Bartholomew,
more frightful still than that of Paris, because it was
conducted with a sort of regularity. The governor Mandelot
gave orders that the Calvinists should be shut up in the
prisons of the Archbishoprics, of the Cordeliers, and of the
Célestins, and be slaughtered in detachments. The executioner
of Lyons, like his brother of Troyes, refused to lend his
hand to the work. “After sentence,” said he, “I will do
what I have to do; there are but too many such executioners
as are needed residing in the town.” A writer
says upon this subject: “What a re-establishment of order
it would have been, if in this unhappy city the governor had
been the executioner, and the executioner the governor!”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>There perished at Lyons, according to some, eight hundred,
according to others, thirteen hundred, fifteen hundred, or
eighteen hundred, Huguenots. The dwellers on the borders
of the Rhone, in Dauphiné, and in Provence, stood aghast at
the sight of so many corpses floating on the waters, or thrown
up on the banks of the river; many were tied to long poles,
and horribly mutilated. “At Lyons,” says Capilupi, a gentleman
attached to the court of the pope, “thanks to the
excellent order and singular prudence of M. de Mandelot,
governor of the town, all the Huguenots were taken one
after the other like sheep.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The correspondence of Mandelot has recently been published.
He expressed his deep regret to Charles IX. that a
few Huguenots had escaped, and supplicated his majesty to
grant him a share of the spoils of the dead. Lyons has witnessed
other massacres, but we have not learned that the
proconsuls of the Convention held out their hands to clutch
the wages of blood.</p>

<p>What was the number of victims throughout France?
De Thou says 30,000; Sully, 70,000; the bishop Péréfixe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
100,000. This last figure is probably exaggerated, if we
reckon those only who met with a violent death. But if
there be added those who died of misery, hunger, grief, the
aged, who were helpless and abandoned, women without
shelter, children without bread, the many wretched beings,
whose lives were shortened by this great catastrophe, it will
be confessed that the number given by Péréfixe is still below
the truth.</p>

<p>The sensation produced by the massacre of Saint Bartholomew
throughout Europe was immense. Men were unwilling
to believe the first accounts. When they were confirmed, all
the courts, all the churches, all the public places, every house
resounded with acclamations; and there was not a hut, into
which the deeds done on that day did not carry, according
to the sentiments of the inhabitants, the exultations of joy,
or the stupor of overwhelming grief.</p>

<p>Many thought, at first, that it was only the first scene of
a vast conspiracy, and that the (Roman) Catholic powers had
resolved to exterminate all the Protestants of Europe. The
Papacy, Philip II., and the court of Charles IX., in fact
never ceased to talk of the complete extirpation of heretics:
the power, not the will, was wanting.</p>

<p>At Rome, the news of the massacre, which Charles IX.
had announced in ambiguous words to the legate, was expected,
and received with transports of joy. The messenger
was gratified with a present of a thousand pieces of gold.
He brought a letter from the nuncio Salviati, written on the
very day, the 24th August, in which this priest said to
Gregory XIII., that “he blessed God to see his pontificate
commence so auspiciously.” The king Charles IX., and the
queen Catherine, were praised for having shown so much
prudence in extirpating this pestilent race, and for having so
well chosen their time that all the rebels had been secured
under lock and key, as in a dovecot (<i lang="it">sotto chiave, in
gabbia</i>).</p>

<p>After having offered up solemn thanksgivings with the
college of cardinals, the pope caused the guns of the castle
of Saint Angelo to be fired, declared a jubilee, and struck a
medal in honour of the great event. The Cardinal de Lorraine,
who had gone to Rome on the election of the new pontiff,
also celebrated the massacre by a great procession to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
French church of Saint Louis. He caused an inscription to
be written on the gates in letters of gold, in which he said
that “the Lord had granted the prayers, which he had offered
to Him for twelve years!”</p>

<p>Madrid shared in the rejoicings of Rome. Philip II.
wrote to Catherine that this was the greatest and best news
that could ever be announced to him. This prince, who has
been surnamed “the Demon of the South,” had other reasons
for his joy besides fanaticism.</p>

<p>In the Low Countries, the duke of Alba cried out, on learning
the assassination of Coligny: “The Admiral is dead;
there is a great captain the less for France, and a great enemy
the less for Spain.”</p>

<p>But how shall we relate the impression produced by the
massacre of Saint Bartholomew in Protestant countries? It
may be seen in the letters of Theodore de Bèze, and others
of his contemporaries, that, for more than a year, they could
not chase from their minds that bloody and horrible image,
and that they spoke of it with a trembling, which attested
the profound shock which their souls [had sustained].</p>

<p>Germany, England, Switzerland, in witnessing the arrival
of a multitude of fugitives appalled and half-dead, and on
hearing from their mouth the narrative of the massacres,
cursed the name of France. At Geneva, a day of abstinence
and prayer was instituted, which has been kept up to this
day. In Scotland, all the pastors preached upon the massacre
of Saint Bartholomew; and the aged Knox, borrowing the
language of the prophets, pronounced in a church at Edinburgh
the following words: “The sentence is gone forth
against this murderer, the king of France, and the vengeance
of God will not be withdrawn from his house. His name
shall be held in execration by posterity; and no one who
shall spring from his loins, shall possess the kingdom in peace,
unless repentance come to prevent the judgment of God.”</p>

<p>The ambassador Lamothe-Fénélon, charged to justify the
massacre at the court of London, on accusing the Admiral of
having conspired against Charles IX., cried out in the bitterness
of his spirit that he blushed to bear the name of a
Frenchman. “Never,” says Hume, “was there a spectacle
more terrible and more touching than that of the solemnity
of this audience. A gloomy grief sat on every countenance;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
the profound silence of night seemed to reign in all the
apartments of the queen. The lords and ladies of the court,
in long mourning apparel, suffered the ambassador to pass
between them without saluting him, or deigning to give him
so much as a look.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> On coming near the queen, Lamothe-Fénelon
stammered out his odious apology, and retired in
confusion.</p>

<p>The justification of the massacre was not an easier matter
in Germany. The ambassador Schomberg did what he
could to support the fable of the plot of Coligny. They
refused even to treat with him otherwise than in writing, so
much did they mistrust an envoy of Charles IX.; so deeply
degraded was the word, the honour, and the name of France!
When the duke of Anjou traversed Germany in 1573, the
Elector Palatine led him into his cabinet, and showing
him the portrait of Coligny, said to him, “You know this
man; you have killed the greatest captain of Christendom,
and you ought not to have done it; for he had rendered
great services to you and the king.” The duke of Anjou
answered that it was the Admiral who had sought to destroy
them all. “We know that tale, sir,” was the cold reply of
the Elector.</p>

<p>If all the circumstances of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew
be well weighed,—the premeditation, the intervention
of the court and of the councils of the king, the snares that
were laid to entrap the Calvinists, the solemn oaths which
had drawn them to Paris, the royal marriage ceremony
stained with blood, the dagger put into the hands of the
people by the chiefs of the state, the hecatombs of human
victims immolated at a time of universal peace, the carnage
prolonged for two months in the provinces, and lastly, the
priests and the princes of the priests, ankle-deep in blood,
lifting their hands to heaven to thank God,—if, we say, we
ponder upon all these circumstances, we cannot escape the
conviction that the slaughter of Saint Bartholomew is the
greatest crime of the Christian era since the invasion of the
men of the North. The Sicilian Vespers, the extermination
of the Albigeois, the tortures of the Inquisition, the murders
committed by the Spaniards in the New World, odious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
though they be, do not unite in the same degree the violation
of all laws, human and divine. And frightful calamities
have sprung from this monstrous crime. Individuals may
indeed commit crimes, which remain unpunished in this
world; but dynasties, castes, and nations, never go unrewarded.</p>

<p>The race of the Valois was exterminated by the poniard,
and nearly every actor in the massacre of Saint Bartholomew
perished by a violent death.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In France, the detestable reign of Henry III. followed,
together with ignoble and brutal manners, laws despised,
the madness of the League, and twenty-five years of civil war.
Abroad, every old and natural alliance was broken off; Protestant
Switzerland, Germany, England, were against France,
or wrapped themselves in a suspicious neutrality; the
country was at length reduced to a depth of opprobrium,
submitting to the tutelage of the king of Spain, and of
humbly begging for an army at Madrid. The great reigns
of Henry IV. and of Richelieu could scarcely restore her to
that place in Europe which she had lost, and they only restored
her by a policy diametrically opposed to that of Saint
Bartholomew’s day.</p>

<p>Where then was the compensation for so much disgrace,
and so many misfortunes? One there was, if any chose to
invoke it. Without the deeds of Saint Bartholomew’s day,
the French Reformation, notwithstanding the losses it had
suffered, would still have constituted an imposing minority;
half the nobility of the kingdom would have remained in
the new communion. It is doubtful whether Henry IV.
would have abjured. In any case, the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes would have been impossible, and there
might have been, in our time, with the progress of population,
five or six millions of the Reformed in France. The
massacre of that day, by murder, emigration, and abjuration,
inflicted a wound, from which France has never recovered.
Is this a justification of the crime?</p>

<p>But we would deprive those, who would dare appeal to
it, of even this resource. “The execrable day of Saint Bartholomew,”
says Châteaubriand, “only made martyrs; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
gave to philosophical ideas an advantage over religious ideas,
which have never since been lost.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Thus there have been some millions of Protestants the
less, and several millions of philosophers or atheists the more;
that is the balance of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew.
What then did the priests gain by diminishing the number
of the disciples of Luther and Calvin, in order to increase
that of the followers of Montaigne and Voltaire? They
gained the anti-Catholic reaction of the eighteenth century,
the hostility of the Constituent Assembly, the massacres of
the Abbaye, the proscriptions of 1793; and what besides?—the
spirit of our own epoch. This spirit, which has passed
from France into Italy, has not yet said its last word to
(Roman) Catholicism!</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XIV">XIV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Calvinists, who had survived the massacre of Saint
Bartholomew, now only thought of organizing their means
of defence. In Cevennes, Rouergue, Vivarais, and Dauphiné,
they had the refuge of their mountains. In the
plains of the south, fifty towns, large and small, Aubenas,
Anduze, Milhau, Sommières, Privas, closed their gates, and
resolved to oppose a desperate resistance to the king’s troops.
At Nismes, the inhabitants were summoned to admit a garrison,
but they refused, notwithstanding they were most
vehemently threatened. A councillor, M. de Clausonne, “<em>a
man of great credit in the district</em>,” says Jean de Serres, “had
made them understand that firmness alone could save them.”</p>

<p>Some gentlemen and pastors, gathered together at Montauban,
even drew up a project of religious and political
federation, “<em>until it should please God to change the heart of
the king, or to raise up a liberator for this poor afflicted people</em>.”
Every town was to appoint a council of one hundred persons,
without distinction of nobles, citizens, or peasants, to direct
all affairs of justice, police, taxes, and war, and these councils
were to elect a general chief. The utmost severity was
recommended to be employed towards the seditious in arms;
but they were to exercise moderation and gentleness towards
peaceable (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX. were then in a condition
to become convinced that they were egregiously deceived
in supposing that all would be at an end when the
principal Calvinist leaders were no more. They had reckoned
too much upon the strength of the old principle of vassalage,
and not enough on the power of religious principle. The
Reformation had given the feeling of a personal conscience
to the humblest, which could but emanate from God, and
this new sort of independence prepared the way for the
advent of modern right.</p>

<p>Wheresoever resistance was possible, it showed itself, more
decisively and obstinately than before; for in the prince
they now saw only an enemy. The siege of Sancerre has
remained famous. This little town held out for more than
ten months against the royalist army, although the inhabitants,
wanting fire-arms, were compelled to defend themselves
with simple slings, which were called the arquebuses
of Sancerre. It endured a famine, which brought back
the recollection of that of Jerusalem, in the time of Titus
and Vespasian. An eyewitness, the pastor Jean de Léry,
has written the details of this siege, day by day. The inhabitants
were reduced to feed upon snails, moles, and wild
herbs, upon bread made with the flour of straw, mixed with
slate-dust, harness of horses, and even the parchment of old
books and title-deeds, which were steeped in water. “I
have seen some served up,” says Léry, “on which the
printed and written characters were still visible, and one
might read from the pieces placed upon the table to be
eaten.”</p>

<p>Moreover, from hour to hour the besieged fell from inanition.
The war killed but eighty-four; hunger destroyed
more than five hundred. “The young children under twelve
years,” says Jean de Serres, “almost all died. It was lamentable
to hear the wailings of the poor fathers and
mothers, of whom nevertheless the greater part fortified
themselves by the assurance of the grace of God. A boy
of ten years old, drawing nigh unto death, seeing his parents
weeping near him, and handling his arms and legs, which were
as dry as wood, said to them: ‘Why do you weep to see me
die of hunger? I do not ask you for bread, mother. I know
you have none. But since God wills that I must thus die, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
must be content. The holy Lazarus, did he not suffer
hunger? Have I not read that in the Bible?’ Saying these
words, he gave up his soul to God.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants had resolved to perish to the last man,
sooner than give themselves up to the cut-throats of Saint
Bartholomew’s day. “Here we fight,” they said; “go and
assassinate elsewhere.” An unexpected event delivered
them. Deputies, who came from Poland to offer the crown
of Jagellons to the duke of Anjou, interceded in their behalf,
and the sureties they demanded were granted to them.</p>

<p>It was the same at La Rochelle. This town, which by
its ancient municipal franchises, formed a kind of republic,
and by its numerous vessels, equalled the forces of the royal
navy, refused to receive a garrison. Fifty-five pastors of
Poitou and of Saintonge, and a multitude of gentlemen,
citizens, and peasants, had, on the first news of the massacre
of Saint Bartholomew, sought an asylum behind its lofty
walls, all of whom were determined to defend themselves to
the death. The proposals made to the people of La Rochelle
having ended in nothing, and the besieging army having
lost many men, Charles IX. took the strange course of sending
a Calvinist negotiator and governor into the town, the
upright Lanoue.</p>

<p>François de Lanoue, surnamed <i lang="fr">Bras-de-Fer</i>, who had only
figured in the second rank in the Huguenot armies, became
their most distinguished chief after the death of Coligny.
He was a man of a wise and penetrating mind, of a generous
character, and of perfect loyalty. He was ever seen in
these unhappy wars, forgetful of danger, intrepid without
boasting, modest in victory, calm and serene under reverses.
He was the Catinat of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>From the peculiarity of his military life, Lanoue was four
or five times made a prisoner. He bore this misfortune like
a soldier who had deserved a better fate, and the (Roman)
Catholics had learned to esteem him. Not one of the Reformed,
without excepting even Coligny, has obtained from
them so much praise. Two Jesuits, Maimbourg and Daniel,
do homage to his rare virtues; they regret nothing in him
but his heresy. The ferocious Montluc calls him as valiant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and prudent a man as any captain in France; the frivolous
Brantôme says it was impossible to grow tired of recounting
his virtues, his valour, and his merits; the sceptic Montaigne
praises his constancy as well as the gentleness of his
manners. Lastly, when Lanoue died, Henry IV. pronounced
over him, in a few words, the most beautiful of funeral orations:
“He was a great warrior, and a still better man!”</p>

<p>During one of his long captivities, he composed some
<em>political and literacy discourses</em>, of which a part form what
are called his <cite>Memoirs</cite>. They are written in a terse, nervous
style, in the language of a soldier and of an honest man,
who speaks to do good, not to acquire applause.</p>

<p>Lanoue was a prisoner of the duke of Alva during the
days of the Saint Bartholomew slaughter: it was this that
saved him. Restored to liberty, he was charged by the king
with the duty of offering conditions of peace to La Rochelle.
He was personally well received, but his mission was rejected,
and the inhabitants defended themselves until the arrival of
the Polish deputies.</p>

<p>The duke of Anjou, who commanded the royal army, was
annoyed at losing his troops and his reputation in this long
siege, and waited impatiently for an opportunity of withdrawing
without excessive disgrace. This was offered him
by his election to the crown of Poland.</p>

<p>A new edict, published the 11th August, 1573, authorized
the public exercise of the Reformed religion, but in three
towns only—La Rochelle, Montauban, and Nismes. The
lords high-justices were only allowed to celebrate marriages,
baptisms, and sacraments, at private meetings, which were
not to exceed ten persons. For all other Calvinists, nothing
but the simple liberty of household worship was permitted.
It was in this edict that the expression of “<em>pretended Reformed
religion</em>,” was first used.</p>

<p>This was but one of those half-measures, contradictory in
principle, and impracticable in action, which only served to exasperate
the minds [of the persons concerned], and to augment
the embarrassments of the case. If the worship of the Reformed
religion was a crime, it ought to have been everywhere
forbidden; if not, it should have been nowhere forbidden.
And what was this arbitrary limitation of certain
assemblies to ten persons? How could Calvinists be prevented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
from meeting together in places where they were in
power? Did they purpose to place a garrison in every town
and every village of the south, and post soldiers in all the
gorges of the mountains?</p>

<p>The Reformed of Montauban drew up, on the 24th August,
a year after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, energetic
remonstrances, day by day, in which they re-demanded all
that had been accorded them by the treaty of 1570, and three
noblemen undertook to present this petition to Charles IX.
The king, whom they met at Villers-Coterets, contrary to
his usual habit, listened to the reading of the memorial
without giving utterance to a word. But Catherine exclaimed,
in an irritated tone of voice, “If your prince Condé
were still alive, and if he were in the heart of France with
twenty thousand cavalry and fifty thousand infantry, he
could not demand one-half of what these people have the
insolence to propose to us.”</p>

<p>This was haughty language; but pride tells badly after
infamous assassinations, and Catherine de Medicis was in no
position to speak in so high a tone. There was nothing but
trouble and anarchy throughout the kingdom; and even in
the royal family division and disorder prevailed. The queen-mother
feared the eldest of her sons, despised the youngest,
loved only the second, who was on the point of starting for
Poland, and was distrusted by all of them.</p>

<p>The three brothers were enemies, and their sister Margaret
of Valois was stained with adultery and incest.</p>

<p>The party of the <em>Politicians</em>, or the Third Estate, was
growing. It was composed of those, who had retained some
remembrance of ancient national honour, and who felt profound
disgust for a court filled with hired assassins, poisoners,
astrologers, and prostitutes. The three sons of the
Constable, François de Montmorency, Damville, and Thoré,
the marshals Cossé and Biron, several provincial governors,
magistrates, and members even of the privy council, were
among the number of these politicians or malcontents. Their
chief was the Duke d’Alençon, since known under the name
of Duke d’Anjou, the last of Queen Catherine’s sons. His
position as the king’s brother gave him credit; but this
prince, then in his twentieth year, was wanting both in
mental and bodily vigour, he was fickle, presumptuous, faithless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
to his word, and ready to throw himself into great enterprises,
which he was incapable of carrying out to a
successful issue.</p>

<p>He even circulated among the citizens new maxims of law
and political liberty. It was at this period that La Boëtie
published his treatise on <cite>Voluntary Servitude</cite>, which even now
astonishes us by its boldness; and François Hotman his
<cite>Franco-Gallia</cite>, in which he maintained that the States-General
might depose bad princes, and appoint their successors.</p>

<p>These malcontents opened negotiations with the Calvinists,
who had strengthened their bond of union at Milhau, on the
16th of December, 1573, by promising <em>fraternity, mutual,
perfect, and eternal, in all things, civil and religious</em>. They
had provided in their act of union for the regular convocation
of their assemblies every six months, a new judicial
code, and the course to be adopted in raising men and money.
This was a state within the state; a sad but inevitable consequence
of the overthrow of all law by the massacre of
Saint Bartholomew. Charles IX. died in the midst of these
troubles, beset by vague and sombre terrors, believing that
he heard groans in the air, starting up out of his sleep at
night, and affected with a strange malady, which caused his
blood to ooze through every pore.</p>

<p>“Two days before his death, he had near him,” says
D’Estoile, “his nurse, whom he much loved, <em>although she was
a Huguenot</em>. As she was seated upon a box, and was just
beginning to doze, she heard the king murmur, weep, and
sigh, which induced her softly to approach his bed, when,
drawing aside the curtains, the king, heaving a profound
sigh, and weeping so much that his sobs interrupted his
utterance, began to say to her: ‘Ah! my nurse, my nurse,
what blood and what murders! Oh! that I should have
followed such wicked counsel! O my God! pardon me,
and have mercy upon me, if it please Thee; I know not
where I am. What shall I do? I am lost, I see plain
enough.’ The nurse replied to him: ‘Sire, these murders
are upon those, who have caused you to commit them! And
since you did not give your consent, and you now regret
them, believe that God will not impute them to you, but
will cover them with the mantle of His Son’s righteousness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
in which alone you must take refuge.’ After this, she having
fetched him a pocket-handkerchief, because his own was wet
with tears, and his majesty having taken it in his hand, he
signed her to retire and leave him to repose.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Charles IX. died on the 30th of May, 1574, not having
yet attained the age of twenty-four years, and rejoicing, he
said, that he left no male heir of tender age, inasmuch as he
would have had too much to suffer.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XV">XV.</h3>
</div>


<p>Catherine de Medicis resumed the regency, which she had
never really abdicated, and endeavoured to negotiate with
the Calvinistic party and the malcontents, until the arrival
of her second son, whom we shall now call Henry III. He
escaped from Poland as from a prison. During his journey
he received some good advice from the Emperor Maximilian,
the doge of Venice, and even from the dukes of Savoy, who
recommended him to re-establish peace in his kingdom by
equitable edicts, which should be faithfully observed; but he
derived no profit from these counsels.</p>

<p>Arrived in France in the month of September, 1574,
Henry III. was joined by his mother at Bourgoin, and made
with her a triumphal entry into Lyons. The Duke d’Alençon
and the king of Navarre, who were free in appearance,
but in reality captives, followed them. It was there that
the course of conduct to be pursued towards the Calvinists
and the politicians was discussed. Several members of the
council,—Pibrac, Bellegarde, Christophe de Thou, Paul de
Foix,—inclined to the side of moderation and compromise;
but Catherine and her Italian confidants, Retz, Nevers, and
Birague, held opposite views, and their opinion biassed that
of Henry III. This prince, who was but twenty-three years
of age, had shown some marks of courage before the treaty
of 1570. He did not want for ability in business, nor for
dignity and grace when he appeared in public. Unhappily,
he had been corrupted by the voluptuousness of the court.
He passed long hours in bedecking himself like a woman,
and dishonoured the dignity of his manhood, and the
majesty of a king, by riotous debauchery. The creatures by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
whom he was surrounded, led him into a contemptible and
shameful indolence, and the baseness of his vices was only
equalled by the extravagance of his superstition.</p>

<p>On his return to France, he joined the brotherhood of the
Flagellants or <i lang="fr">Frères-Battus</i> of Avignon; and in a solemn
procession, he led the white, Catherine the black, and Cardinal
d’Armagnac the blue order of these <i lang="fr">Frères-Battus</i>. They
went through the city with naked feet, uncovered heads,
with chaplets of death-bones at their girdles, and making
blood spirt from their shoulders with cords. Some historians
have been desirous of discovering political reasons under
these ignoble masquerades. What is the use of going so far
to seek for what is so near? Between the excess of depravity
and the extreme of bigotry, there is a singular and close
relationship.</p>

<p>In the month of December, the Cardinal de Lorraine
caught a fever, from the effects of which he died. The queen-mother,
whom history accuses of having been on too intimate
terms with him, could not assume on this occasion her habitual
dissimulation. On seating herself at table the same
evening, as they handed her a glass, she began to tremble so
much that it had almost fallen from her hands, and she
exclaimed, “Jesus! it is the cardinal that I see.” During
the night, for more than a month, she would not remain
alone, being incessantly followed by this melancholy apparition,
and saying to her women, “Drive away that cardinal;
do you not see that he beckons me with his finger?” What
was it that had passed between her and this priest that a
woman like Catherine de Medicis should have been so terrified
at his death?</p>

<p>At Paris Henry III. continued his devotional practices;
his was the religion not of a king, but of a besotted monk.
He caused oratories (otherwise called <i lang="fr">paradis</i>) to be erected
in the churches, where he took his place every day during
Lent. He also followed the processions dressed in a false
wig and ridiculous costume, and in the company of a fool
called Sibillot, “the greatest scoundrel,” says Jean de Serres,
“that could be found in France, who walked between his
master and Cardinal de Ferrara; and whilst the priests sang
the burden of their hymn <i lang="la">Ora pro nobis</i>, this fool was grinning
and uttering silly jests, and playing ridiculous antics.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
After this, Henry III. would proceed in his carriage with
the queen his wife, through the streets, and by the houses of
Paris, purchasing little dogs, monkeys, and other rare animals,
for which he was made to pay their weight in gold.</p>

<p>At the end of six months he was despised even by the
dregs of the people, and by his domestics. A placard in the
following terms was distributed throughout the city:
“Henry, by the grace of his mother, inert king of France,
porter of the Louvre, churchwarden of Saint Germain l’Auxerrois,
harlequin of the churches of Paris, plaiter of his wife’s
collars, and her hair-dresser, guardian of the four mendicants,
conscript father of the Blancs-Battus, and protector of the
Capuchins.”</p>

<p>The number of malcontents still increased, and made
more direct proposals of alliance to the Calvinists. They
were divided as to the course which they ought to adopt.
On one side were the Consistorial Reformed, as they were
called, on the other, the nobles, great personages, magistrates,
and councillors of the towns. This distinction had already
been made in the first wars, and it became more marked in
those which followed.</p>

<p>The Consistorials, composed mostly of clergymen, principally
occupied themselves with the interests of the faith,
and only wished to perform their duties quietly. Tradesmen
and merchants, for the most part considering these
questions under their most simple aspect, and deciding upon
them in a religious point of view, felt more repugnance than
the others to taking up arms, and only did so at the last
extremity, when they were absolutely prevented from serving
God according to their conscience; nevertheless when
they were once on the battle-field, they would not accept
peace without a sufficient guarantee for the liberty of the
church. The nobles, on the contrary, always on the alert
to raise levies, were more ready to compromise religious
differences, and looked mainly to their personal position in
the state. The Consistorials were the strongest in number,
but the weakest in rank; they were habitually compelled to
submit to the domination of the Calvinist nobility, and to
share their fortunes.</p>

<p>This was the result of their alliance with the malcontents.
It was concluded in Languedoc, notwithstanding the opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of the Consistorials, and the consequences of it were soon
apparent. “The dissoluteness and strange scandals of the
politicians, who were mixed with the religious orders,”
says a contemporary, “finished by extinguishing whatever
warmth of affection for piety and discipline remained to
them. Marshal Damville cared but little to observe the
conditions promised by him, and included in the association.
However, he made use of fair expressions to the clergy and
others; but debauchery advanced, and flowed along far and
wide, like a torrent. Exactions and brigandage perceptibly
increased.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The war continued with varying results, and
without any decisive battle being fought. The heroic defence
of the small town of Livron, in Dauphiné, has been related.
When Henry III. presented himself before its gates in the
month of January, 1575, the besieged called out from the
ramparts, “Ah! murderers, you shall not stab us in our
beds, as you did the Admiral and others. Bring out these
bedaubed and perfumed favourites; let them see if they can
hold up their heads, even against our women!” Henry III.
was compelled to swallow this insult; two-thirds of his little
army perished before the town, and the siege was raised.
The prince of Condé and the king of Navarre, who had been
retained at court since the events of Saint Bartholomew’s
day, succeeded in making their escape, and abjured
(<ins class="corr" id="tn-185" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'one at Strasburg'">
one at Strasbourg</ins>, the other at Tours) the (Roman) Catholic faith,
which, under fear of assassination, had been imposed upon
them. The Duke d’Alençon himself took refuge in his appanage
of Dreux, and published a manifesto, in which he took
the French of both religions under his safeguard.</p>

<p>Having no longer either men or money wherewith to oppose
the confederates, who threatened to march on Paris,
the court endeavoured to gain over the chiefs of the Third
Estate, by offering them personal advantages, and submitting
very favourable articles of peace to the Calvinists—free
exercise of their religion throughout the kingdom, except
at Paris, and within a circle of two leagues; admission
to all public offices; equal numbers in the Parliaments:
eight places of surety; the right to open schools and convoke
synods; the restoration of the memory of Coligny;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
and, in short, the re-establishment of the king of Navarre,
of the prince of Condé, and of the nobles of the religion in
their appanages and governments. This treaty, called the
<em>Peace of Monsieur</em>, because it had been concluded under the
guarantee of the king’s brother, was signed at Chastenoy, on
the 6th of May, 1576.</p>

<p>Catherine <ins class="corr" id="tn-186" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and Heny III. only'">
and Henry III. only</ins> proposed, in putting their
signatures to this treaty, to dissolve the alliance of the politicians
with the Calvinists. This accomplished, it was
treated as void. The (Roman) Catholics of Picardy were
secretly authorized to repulse the prince of Condé, who had
come to take possession of his government, and persecution
did not cease for a single day.</p>

<p>The Reformed of Paris, to adduce only one example, in
obedience to the edict, which enabled them to worship at
two leagues from the city, held a meeting at Noisy-le-Sec.
The populace, on their return, killed several of them, and
wounded a larger number. Complaint was made to the
king, who at this moment was playing at the ring, dressed
as an Amazon (says d’Estoile), but he took no more notice
of them than if these murders had been committed in
another part of the world.</p>

<p>One article of this treaty had decreed the early convocation
of the States-General. They eventually assembled at
Blois, in the month of December, 1576; but no longer with
the spirit of the States of Orleans. A great part of the
nobility had again joined the (Roman) Catholic church, and
the misfortunes of the kingdom had ulcerated the heart of
the citizens. The deputies of the three orders agreed to
demand the unity of religion. They prayed the king to
command the ministers, deacons, superintendents, schoolmasters,
and other teachers, to quit the kingdom, in default
of which they should be proceeded against as guilty of a
capital crime.</p>

<p>Unity, thus expressed, was nothing else than war. But to
make war, money was necessary; and when this was alluded
to, each of the three orders excused itself. The clergy declared
that they had been very much impoverished by the
disorders of the kingdom, and could give nothing; the
nobility only offered their swords; and the Third Estate
commissioned its speaker to say, that it contemplated the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
reunion of all the king’s subjects by gentle means, without
war—a great and puerile mockery.</p>

<p>The Calvinists, however, at the news of these resolutions,
had again recourse to arms; but, deprived of the aid of the
malcontents of the (Roman) Catholic party, and disunited
among themselves, their plans did not prosper. The Consistorialists,
this time, were the most determined, because with
them it had become a question of losing all, or saving all, in
the exercise of their religion. Earnest remonstrances were
therefore addressed to the nobles by the consistory of La
Rochelle. Theodore de Bèze wrote from Geneva: “I cannot
in good conscience see how we can consent to limit the spirit
of God to certain places; above all, to shut it out from the
towns, which do not die and change, like the hearts and
houses of princes. I cannot bring my mind to believe that
God either can or will bless such agreements, and I would
counsel you to place your heads on the block, and to suffer
everything without resistance, if it must come to that,
rather than approve of such conditions.” These complaints
of the Consistorials were disregarded, and the nobles of the
party signed a peace at Bergerac, in the month of September,
1577. On the 8th of October following, appeared the
Edict of Poitiers, which only granted to the mass of the
Reformed the simple liberty of conscience, with admission to
public offices. The exercise of religion was limited to the
places, in which it was professed when the treaty was under
signature. Henry III. boasted of this edict as his own
work; he liked to say, “<em>My edict, my treaty</em>;” but it
was no better observed than those which had preceded it.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XVI">XVI.</h3>
</div>


<p>Catherine de Medicis had conceived a method of overcoming
the Huguenot nobles, during the peace, whom it had
been found impossible to vanquish by arms; and this was
by debauching them. She passed through the provinces
with a numerous troop of maids of honour (sometimes to
the number of one hundred and fifty), who were called her
flying squadron. Everywhere throughout her progress, balls,
<i lang="fr">fêtes</i>, gallantries, and intrigues took place, in the midst of
which the former austerity of the companions of Coligny
was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>It was thus, under the pretext of conducting Margaret of
Valois to the house of her husband, the king of Navarre,
that Catherine set out, in the month of July, 1578, for the
southern provinces. The Béarnese king, who had too soon
forgotten the lessons of his mother during his long residence
at the Louvre, could not resist the seductions with which he
was surrounded. “The court of the king of Navarre,” says
Agrippa d’Aubigné, “was renowned for its brave nobility
and virtuous ladies. Idleness attracted vice to it, as heat
draws serpents. The queen of Navarre took the rust off
their wits, and let it gather on their arms. She taught the
king her husband that a cavalier was without a soul when
he was without an amour.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The same historian relates that Catherine de Medicis
affected a style of language borrowed from the Bible. She
had composed a vocabulary of expressions in use among the
most rigid of the Reformed, and made use of them, sometimes
as a matter of policy, and sometimes in derision.
“She had learned by heart,” says he, “several phrases, which
she termed Consistorial; as, <em>to approve of the counsel of Gamaliel</em>;
or, <em>beautiful are the feet of those who preach the
gospel of peace</em>; to call the king, <em>the anointed of the Lord,
the image of the living God</em>, with several sentences of the
Epistle of St. Peter, in favour of dominion; she would often
exclaim, <em>Let God judge between you and us! I call the Eternal
to witness! Before God and his angels!</em> This style,
which the ladies called among themselves the <em>language of
Canaan</em>, was studied in the evening, when the queen retired
to rest, and not without merriment.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Before and after the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i>, conferences were held, from
which resulted the explicative Treaty of Nérac, signed on
the 28th of February, 1579. It added nothing essential to
the Edict of Poitiers. The king of Navarre obtained only
some fresh places of safety in Guienne and Languedoc, on
condition that he should only retain them for six months.</p>

<p>An intrigue of the court caused arms again to be taken
up, and this ridiculous quarrel was named <em>the war of the
amorous</em>; but the great body of the Reformed took no part
in it. It terminated by the signing of a peace at the castle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
of Fleix, in Périgord, on the 26th of November, 1580, which
treaty confirmed the Edict of Poitiers; the Béarnese king,
however, conquered, the appanage being given as a dowry to
his wife in Agenois and Quercy.</p>

<p>Four or five years elapsed without war being declared, but
they passed neither with security nor repose. Upon different
occasions, the Reformed sent whole volumes of grievances
and remonstrances to the court. Promises of reparation
were made, but the next day the council troubled themselves
no more about them.</p>

<p>Another means was invented of weakening the Calvinist
party, and it had better success than all its predecessors. This
was to remove or leave out the Huguenots from public appointments.
Although the Edict of Pacification accorded
to them an equal right of admission to all public offices, a
thousand pretexts were made use of to elude this article.
It was an indirect and underhand persecution, but it was
both systematic and constant.</p>

<p>Mézeray pretends that these proceedings converted more
of the Reformed in four years than either the executioner
or war had done in forty. This is saying too much. It is
certain, however, that many nobles yielded to the temptation
of holding offices or court favours. Some, according to the
historian Elie Benoît, ashamed of abandoning their religion
themselves, made their children renounce it on the score of
affection and paternal foresight. Others, on the contrary,
declared themselves (Roman) Catholics, that they might
enter upon offices, and caused their children to be brought
up in the Reformed communion, in order, as they said, to
tranquillize their conscience. Has the human heart ever
been found deficient in sophisms when desirous of gratifying
its passions?</p>

<p>But the more ardent (Roman) Catholics again complained,
and also accused the leniency of Henry III. and Queen
Catherine. Their spirit of opposition was increased by the
death of the duke of Alençon or Anjou, which took place in
1584. Henry III. had no children, and his physicians
feared that he would not survive the year. The race of
Valois then would become extinct. Who would succeed
him? Henry of Bourbon, according to the ancient laws of
the kingdom. He was the nearest heir male, and no one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
could contest with him the title of first prince of the blood.
But a heretic, an apostate, one who had relapsed (for they
affected to look in a serious light at the abjuration, which
had been imposed upon him at the massacre of Saint Bartholomew),
one, in short, excommunicated by the Holy See,
should he mount the throne of the most Christian kings?
This single thought shocked three-fourths of the nation, and
the League experienced an immense augmentation.</p>

<p>The <em>League</em> or <em>Holy Union</em> had existed since the year
1576. It even dated further back, and extended beyond the
French frontier. The Cardinal de Lorraine formed the plan
at the Council of Trent; the Jesuits had adopted and enlarged
it; Philip II., the popes, and Duke Henry of Guise,
had successively put their hand to it, and by degrees the
association became developed to such an extent as to aspire to
rouse (Roman) Catholic Europe in order that it might crush
Protestantism. It was in France that the first blow was struck.</p>

<p>After having exterminated the Huguenots, the new crusaders
would have overthrown the rebels of Holland, then
they would unitedly have invaded England, and afterwards
Germany and the north, never stopping until they had either
brought back the last of the disciples of Luther and Calvin
to the Church of Rome, or drowned them in their own blood.</p>

<p>Philip II. was the principal leader of this vast conspiracy.
In his retreat of San-Lorenzo he incessantly revolved, as
the published correspondence of our times attests, these
great and dark thoughts. He understood but two things in
the world,—the sovereign power of the prince in political
matters, and the popes infallibility in questions of religion.
The right of resistance to the temporal power, and the privilege
of search on points of faith, were in his eyes the most
detestable of crimes. All authority, in his idea, was concentrated
in the hands of a few chiefs, and there was no
liberty beyond or beneath them. The two swords were to
strike together, to keep the people enslaved and trembling;
and he added the axe of the executioner, with the fire of
the inquisitor, and even the poniard of the assassin; for
this (Roman) Catholic king descended to such a depth of infamy
as to confer letters of nobility on the relations of Balthazar
Gérard, the murderer of the prince of Orange. Philip II.
had conceived this execrable system of terrorism, that it might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
redound to the profit of royalty and the pontificate. But it
only resulted in the downfall of Spain and the execration of
posterity.</p>

<p>The Holy See entertained implacable resentment at the
sight of heresy raising itself up so pertinaciously, and was
desirous of establishing at any cost, the one faith, under one
single spiritual chief. Cardinals, bishops, priests, Jesuits,
and monks of all orders, went about spreading these maxims
of extermination, at the courts and in the bosom of the
people, from the pulpits and in the confessional.</p>

<p>In France, Henry of Guise, <i lang="fr">le Balafré</i>, was the soul of the
League. Keeping himself at first in obscurity, he at length
came more prominently forward, and made himself esteemed
by the masses, in proportion to the contempt which Henry III.
inspired. He endeavoured to be affable to wards the lower
orders, was a sure friend, an inexorable enemy, generous
towards those who were serviceable to him, prodigal of gold
to the covetous, and never wanting in promises to the ambitious;
he also showed attentions to the citizens and artisans
of Paris, which were very flattering to their vanity. Capable
of profound dissimulation, he yet assumed the frank and
open air of a soldier. As a great captain he understood still
better the art of gaining victories at the proper time, than
that of merely achieving them. He evinced much zeal for
the church of Rome, but without falling into the abject
devotions of Henry III.; and, always watchful of his fortunes,
he thought nothing more of religion than as a means of improving
them.</p>

<p>One of the dependants of his house, Jacques d’Humières,
was employed in 1576 to recruit in the cities of Picardy for
adherents to the League, and that association soon spread
through all the provinces. There was some difference in the
articles which were presented for them to swear to, and to
sign, but their ultimate object was the same—a mutual understanding
between the members of the union; absolute obedience
to the secret chief of the League; and an engagement
to sacrifice everything, body and goods, in order to exterminate
heretics and to re-establish the unity of religion.</p>

<p>The association was composed of very different elements.
For the Guises, it was a question of aggrandizement and
power; for one portion of the citizens and magistrature, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
means of establishing public order; for another part, a precautionary
measure against the reprisals, which the Calvinists
might adopt towards the murderers and spoliators of Saint
Bartholomew’s day; for the tradespeople, a manifestation of
antipathy against the Huguenots; and for the priesthood, an
affair of religious domination. Among these, as it always
happens, there were conscientious men, who devoted themselves
to the prosecution of an idea; and ambitious or hypocritical
individuals, who thrived upon the sincerity of others.
The most moderate were made to figure in the advance-guard,
for fear of frightening the well-disposed; but those
who were high in rank were resolved to reap all the advantages
of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>At Paris, the prebendary Launoy, the curates Prévôt and
Boucher, and adventurers of every description, addressed themselves
to the very lowest orders,—the men of the slaughter-houses,
mariners, horse-dealers, and street-porters,—and told
them that the Huguenots were watching their opportunity
to cut the throats of all good (Roman) Catholics, and that
ten thousand of them were concealed in the faubourg Saint
Germain, ready to commence the massacre. The most violent
clubs assembled in the churches, and the preachers,
monks, or doctors of the Sorbonne, hounded on the people to
the most bloody excesses, invoking the will of Heaven. The
same provocatives were repeated throughout the kingdom,
and the League became a formidable combination.</p>

<p>Henry III., not daring openly to oppose the League,
thought that he should perform a master-piece of policy by
signing the articles of the union with his own hand; but he
only emboldened the League and disgraced himself. From
being king, he became the second among the conspirators,
and a conspirator despised by his accomplices.</p>

<p>The League demanded that he should declare the king of
Navarre disinherited, and name the Cardinal de Bourbon as
his heir, an old man of upwards of sixty years of age, of
limited capacity, of feeble character, and a priest of little
reputation, since he had lived in habits of effeminate and
dissolute luxury. This cardinal would have made way for
the duke of Guise. Henry III. was aware of this, he knew
also that the Lorraines only awaited an opportunity of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
him turn monk, and shutting him up in a cloister, as other
do-nothing kings had been treated in times gone by.</p>

<p>At this critical moment Henry III. displayed some courage,
and refused. The kingdom was then a prey to the greatest
anarchy; neither authority, government, nor law any longer
existed. The Leaguers published manifestoes in the name of
the Cardinal de Bourbon, and by treachery or force obtained
possession of Toul, Verdun, Lyons, Châlons, Bourges, and other
important towns. Henry III., who had no army to oppose
to them, contracted a peace with the duke of Guise, at the
expense of the Huguenots. He engaged by the treaty of
Nemours, signed in 1585, to deprive them not only of the
public exercise of their religion, but also of liberty of conscience.
It was ordered that all the Calvinist clergy should
quit the kingdom at the expiration of a month, and that all
the Reformed should abjure or emigrate at the end of six
months, under penalty of death and confiscation of their property.
This term was shortly afterwards reduced to fifteen
days, as if it were intended to take away from these abjurations
even the appearance of good faith.</p>

<p>In thus putting an end to war on one side, it again broke
out on the other. It no longer originated in some
wretched court quarrel, but it became a war of liberty, of
religion, of fortune, and for existence itself.</p>

<p>The Edict of Nemours was apparently intended to be so
rigorously executed, that the king rejected the request of
some poor women, who prayed to be permitted to live with
their children in some corner of France, which it might
please his majesty to assign to them. Henry III. would only
promise to have them conveyed without injury or insult to
England. Some women were even burned at Paris after
the treaty,—the atrocious laws of Henry II. were again
reverted to.</p>

<p>Some timid Calvinists endeavoured to find refuge by the
use of equivocal terms, such as: “Since it pleases the king,”
&amp;c., and in that manner they subscribed, not an abjuration,
but an act of obedience to the royal will. The bishops perceived
this, and were most rigorous with those whom they
admitted. One of them, the Bishop d’Angers, gave directions
that none of the Huguenots should be received until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
they had undergone a lengthened course of instruction, and
a strict examination on points of faith. Thus the prince
enjoined their conversion in fifteen days, and the bishops
repulsed those, who were not minutely versed in all the details
of the Romish doctrines. Thus there was nothing but contradictions.</p>

<p>Henry III. did not, however, wish to crush the Calvinist
party entirely; he feared lest too much power should be
given to the League, and to the duke of Guise. His most
ardent desire was to ruin each of the two parties by means
of the other, and he was frequently heard to mutter: “I
will be revenged upon my enemies by my enemies.”</p>

<p>Seeing that the king was deficient in energy in the prosecution
of the heretics, Pope Sixtus V. lost patience, and
fulminated a bull of excommunication against the Bourbons,
which twenty-five cardinals signed with him. It stated that
Henry of Bourbon, formerly king of Navarre, and Henry,
also of Bourbon, Prince de Condé, being heretics, having
relapsed into heresy, and not having repented, were deprived
of all their principalities, they and their heirs for ever. If
any one again dared to obey “this bastard and detestable
race of Bourbons,” and to recognise as his sovereign this
former king of the pretended kingdom of Navarre, he should
incur the same excommunication. Never, even in the most
violent invectives against “the <i lang="fr">ci-devant</i> king, Louis Capet,”
did the Convention of 1793 so completely fail in decency
and modesty.</p>

<p>The Béarnese king replied to this insolent bull, by causing
a protest to be posted up, on the 6th of November, 1585, in
all the public resorts of Rome, commencing thus: “Henry,
by the grace of God, king of Navarre, sovereign prince of
Béarn, first peer and prince of France, protests against the
declaration and excommunication of Sixtus V., calling himself
pope of Rome, declares that it is false, and appeals
against the same as slanderous to the court of the Peers of
France. And in that, which touches the crime of heresy,
of which he is falsely accused by the declaration, he says and
maintains that Sixtus, calling himself pope in that behalf,
hath falsely and maliciously lied, and that he is himself a
heretic, as shall be made manifest in full council freely and
lawfully assembled.” It is said that Sixtus, astonished by so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
bold an act, began from that time properly to appreciate the
character of his adversary.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XVII">XVII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The prince of Condé was first in the field; still young and
full of zeal for religion, he was impatient to vindicate his
claim to the high place, to which his birth entitled him.
But he possessed less military talent than courage; he passed
the Loire upon false intelligence, and having advanced too
far, lost at the gates of Angers the first army, which was
raised against the Leaguers.</p>

<p>In Languedoc, the Duke de Montmorency (formerly Marshal
Damville) renewed his alliance with the Calvinist party,
and nothing took place in this province but the encounters
of partisans. Lesdiguières, at the head of the Huguenots of
Dauphiny, took possession of several strong places, and managed
to keep all that country quiet. The king of Navarre
maintained his position in Guienne. Henry III. courted
him, and proposed that he should change his religion, in
order to deprive the League of its most formidable argument;
and Catherine de Medicis, always ready to open
negotiations, visited and conferred with the Béarnese king,
towards the end of the year 1586, at the castle of Saint
Bris, near Cognac. But her Italian <i lang="fr">finesse</i> this time met
with no success.</p>

<p>The war continued without any important engagement
until the battle of Coutras. The two armies met on the
20th of October, 1587. They presented a striking contrast.
On the side of the Calvinists there were from five to six
thousand men, badly attired, with buffalo-skins in tatters,
and having no other ornaments than their faithful swords
and good cuirasses. On the side of the (Roman) Catholics,
who were commanded by the Duke de Joyeuse, there were
from ten to twelve thousand men, the flower of the courtiers,
dressed in silk and velvet, with arms chased with silver and
enamel, their lances adorned with large streamers, floating
plumes, and bearing on their scarfs the mottoes of their
mistresses. The former were soldiers fashioned in trouble
and hardship; the latter elegant cavaliers, who seemed as if
they had assembled to assist at a tournament.</p>

<p>Some days before the battle, at the instance of the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Mornay, Henry publicly expressed his repentance for having
brought dishonour upon a family of La Rochelle. Upon being
told that the clergy were very severe towards him, “A person
cannot,” said he, “humiliate himself too much before
God, nor too boldly brave mankind.”</p>

<p>At the commencement of the battle the Reformed kneeled
down, and sang the 118th Psalm:—“This is the day that
the Lord hath made,” &amp;c. “S’death,” cried the nobles in
Joyeuse’s camp, “they tremble—the poltroons—they confess!”
“Gentlemen,” said an old officer, “when the Huguenots are
in this vein they are ready to fight well.”</p>

<p>They fought bravely, in truth, and the rout of the (Roman)
Catholics was complete. The Duke de Joyeuse fell, together
with half his army. The Béarnese king showed great
humanity after the victory; he gave orders that the wounded
should be cared for, dismissed nearly all the prisoners without
ransom, and deplored that so much French blood had
been shed.</p>

<p>At the news of this defeat, the indignation of the League
was redoubled against Henry III., and the doctors of the
Sorbonne decided at a conventicle, that the crown might be
taken from an incapable prince, as a worthless guardian is
deprived of the charge intrusted to him. All eyes were now
turned towards the duke of Guise, who had just cut in pieces
a numerous army of German troopers that had been sent to
aid the Huguenots.</p>

<p>In consequence of this success, the popularity of the Balafré
had greatly increased. The pope sent him a sword which he
had blessed; Philip II. and the duke of Savoy congratulated
him; and the Parisians, excited by the voice of the priesthood,
proclaimed him the saviour of the Church.</p>

<p>He showed himself grateful for the assistance of the
clergy; for, at a meeting held at Nancy, it was by his
means decided that a proposal should be made to the king
to publish the canons of the Council of Trent, and to institute
the Holy Inquisition in France;—“a worthy means,”
said the manifesto, “of exterminating heresy, provided the
officers of the Inquisition be strangers.”</p>

<p>From the enthusiasm of the priests and people sprung the
day of the Barricades, the 12th of May, 1588. Henry of
Guise was carried in triumph to the Louvre; and the king,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
whose personal liberty was endangered, fled disguised as a
countryman, accompanied by some footmen, swearing in his
heart, death to him whom he called “<em>the king of Paris</em>.”</p>

<p>Five months afterwards, he opened the second States-General
of Blois, which were entirely composed of Leaguers.
He protested by the most solemn oaths that he was desirous
of labouring to accomplish the total extirpation of heresy,
and that no one should be more ardent in the work than
himself. But he was not believed. The duke of Guise
alone possessed the confidence of the States, and had only
another step to ascend in order to seat himself upon the
throne of France.</p>

<p>Henry III. prevented this by causing him to be assassinated
on the 23rd of December, by some of his nobles.
“Ah! my friends, ah! my friends,” exclaimed the Balafré,
when he felt that he was pierced by a dagger, “have mercy!”
When all was over, the king came out of his closet, and asked
one of the murderers, “Do you think that he is dead, Loignac?”
“I believe that he is, sire; he has the hue of death
upon him,” was the answer. Henry having for a moment
looked at his victim, kicked him in the face. Had the
duke retained a last breath of life, he could but then have
remembered the murdered Coligny.</p>

<p>Henry III. left the room and visited his mother, who was
ill in bed. “The king of Paris exists no longer, madam,”
said he; “henceforth I shall reign alone; I have now no
rival.” “It is a clean cut, my son,” replied Catherine, “but
it must be sewn up again; have you taken proper precautions?”</p>

<p>Twelve days after this event Catherine died, leaving her
last son with an insecure crown, the kingdom inflamed, and
the whole nation discontented. She descended to the tomb
amid the execration of the Calvinists, and the disdain of the
(Roman) Catholics. “There were none to care for her, her
malady, or her death,” says L’Estoile, “and no more notice
was taken of her than of a dead she-goat.” Lincestre, one
of the preachers of the League, in announcing this news to
the people, said, “A difficulty presents itself to-day, and that
is whether the Church should pray for one, who has lived so
ill, and so often countenanced heresy; upon which I would
say, that if you should think it worth while to venture upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
giving her a <i lang="la">Pater</i> or an <i lang="la">Ave</i>, as an act of charity, it will be
as useful to her as it can be.” Here then were the fruits of
thirty years of intrigue, treason, and crime.</p>

<p>The murder of the duke of Guise interposed an abyss
between the king and the Leaguers. Seventy theologians of
the Sorbonne, after having attended mass, absolved the people
from their oath of fealty. The priests formed a procession
of one hundred thousand children, who carried lighted
tapers, and extinguished them by trampling them underfoot,
whilst repeating, “God grant that the race of Valois may
soon become utterly extinct!” From the pulpits, dreadful
imprecations were denounced against Henry III.; the duty
of regicide was openly proclaimed, and one of the preachers
declared that France could only recover from its malady by
a potion of French blood.</p>

<p>Reduced to the greatest extremity, and compelled to shut
himself up in the city of Tours as a last resource, Henry III.
made advances to the Calvinists, who were in possession of
the country on the other side of the Loire.</p>

<p>The latter had undertaken no enterprise of importance.
They had lost, in the month of March, 1588, Henry of Condé,
their second chief in rank, but the first perhaps in the confidence
with which he inspired them. This prince died at
Saint Jean d’Angély, at the age of thirty-four years. His
early death, and the mysterious circumstances attending it,
gave rise to suspicion that he had been poisoned, which was
confirmed after the body had been opened. His wife, Princess
Charlotte de la Trémoille, a recent convert, and surrounded
by a (Roman) Catholic family of high rank, was accused of
the crime. This affair, however, which was subsequently
brought before the Parliament of Paris, has never been properly
cleared up.</p>

<p>Whilst the League held its States-General at Blois, the
Calvinists convoked a political assembly at La Rochelle. It
was opened on the 14th of November, 1588, in the town-hall.
The king of Navarre attended with Viscount de
Turenne, Prince de la Trémoille, and the other nobles of
their party. There was more order and respect for authority
displayed in this assembly than at that at Blois. Rules were
determined upon in reference to the administration of justice,
the finances, the levy of soldiers, military discipline,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and to all those objects, which were of interest to the common
weal. Before separating, the deputies addressed a
memorial to Henry III., in which they prayed for the re-establishment
of the Edict of January.</p>

<p>After the death of the duke of Guise, the Béarnese king
addressed a manifesto to the three estates of France, in
which he protested his fidelity to the crown, and invited the
French nation to put an end to their differences. “I conjure
you all, then,” said he, in conclusion, “Catholics, servants of
the king, as well as those who are not so; I appeal to you
as Frenchmen; I beseech you to have pity on this state and
on yourselves. We have all committed and suffered evil
enough. We have been intoxicated, senseless and furious,
for four years. Is not this sufficient? Has not God visited
all enough to make us wise now, and to appease our wrath?”</p>

<p>Although the two kings had a common interest in coming
to an understanding, long hesitation was manifested on both
sides. Could Henry tender his hand to his oldest enemies?
Would he not, in calling them to his aid, justify all the reproaches
of the Leaguers, who accused him of never having
ceased to hold secret correspondence with the Huguenots?
And the Calvinists on their side, did they not know that
the hatred of Henry III. against heresy was inveterate,
and that he could never become sincerely reconciled to the
brothers and sons of those, whom he had massacred on Saint
Bartholomew’s day? Could they so forget that inconceivable,
that shameful speech of Henry III. before the Estates
of Blois, that even when he promised by the most sacred
oaths to spare the heretics, he was not to be believed? But
notwithstanding these mutual dislikes, they were forced to
yield to necessity.</p>

<p>On the 30th April, 1589, the two kings had a first interview
at the castle of Plessis-les-Tours, an old manor of
Louis XI. The Béarnese king caused a portion of his nobility
to cross the water, and entered the boat with his guards.
During the passage, he only said to Marshal d’Aumont, who
had been sent to him by the king, “Marshal, I go upon your
word.” Arrived at the other bank, he kneeled before Henry
III., who raised and embraced him.</p>

<p>On the same day he wrote to Mornay: “The ice has been
broken, not without numerous warnings, that if I ventured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
I was a dead man.” His faithful minister replied to him,
“Sire, you have acted as you should, but as no one ought to
have counselled you.”</p>

<p>From this period the affairs of Henry III. took a favourable
turn. The Leaguers were defeated in several encounters.
An army of forty-two thousand men, commanded by the
two kings, advanced to the gates of Paris and prepared to
commence a general assault. The Duke de Mayenne had
only eight thousand disheartened troops. The leaders of the
League began to lose all hope, the priests were cast down;
the Reformed looked forward to a better future, when the
knife of a Dominican monk, Jacques Clément, disconcerted
at the same time the hopes and the fears of each party.</p>

<p>Henry III. died of his wound, at the end of eighteen
hours, on the 10th August, 1589. With him the race of
Valois became extinct. Francis I. met with a shameful
death; Henry II. was mortally wounded in a tournament;
Francis II. did not attain the age of manhood; Charles IX.
expired in the convulsions of an unknown malady; the
Duke d’Alençon prematurely expired in debauchery and
disgrace; and Henry III. perished by the knife of an assassin.
The Valois carry on their forehead the ineffaceable
brand of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>If history ought not to be a mere object of curiosity, it is
still desirable to tell what were the ideas of religion and the
manners of this court, where such fanatic intolerance was
paramount.</p>

<p>After the celebration of mass, astrologers were visited at
their houses, in order to procure philtres and poisons. All
the magic arts, all the witchcraft imported from Italy
by Catherine de Medicis, were in vogue. The courtiers kept
small wax figures in their cabinets, and pierced their hearts
with pins, pronouncing at the same time cabalistic words,
in order, as they believed, to cause the death of their enemies.</p>

<p>Religious ceremonies were made use of to rouse the vilest
and most sanguinary passions. The sermons of priests connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
with the League, like torches, inflamed the whole
kingdom. Processions were projected to excite the ferocity
of the populace, and frequently presented spectacles of indecency
and impiety. At Chartres, after the day of the barricades,
a Capuchin represented before Henry III. the Saviour
ascending Calvary. He had painted drops of blood, that
appeared to ooze from his head, which was crowned with
thorns; he seemed to drag along with difficulty a cross of
painted cardboard, and fell down at intervals, uttering piercing
cries. At Paris, after the assassination of the duke of
Guise, men, women, and young girls, covered only with a
chemise or sheet, formed night-processions; and in the
midst of sacred songs gave themselves up to Saturnalia,
worthy of the pagan world in its most vicious days.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the League, who bore arms which had
been blessed by the priests, committed acts of infamy, even
on the steps of altars. The atrocities perpetrated in the
churches of Saint-Symphorien, in that of D’Arquenay, and in
a crowd of others, cannot be related.</p>

<p>Religion of the king, religion of the court, religion of the
clergy, religion of the people and of the soldiers,—what
wretched mockery was it all! Manners were on the same
level; the cardinal of Lorraine, and the greater part of the
prelates, impudently violated all the laws of chastity. The
Balafré was leaving a night debauch when he was assassinated.
Margaret of Valois, the princess of Condé, the
duchesses of Nemours, of Guise, of Montpensier, of Nevers,
led a life of the foulest immorality. Two of them having
caused the heads of their lovers to be cut off, kissed and
embalmed them, and each kept that of her own lover among
her love-tokens. It is well known in what manner the duchess
of Montpensier, sister of Henry of Guise, nerved the arm
of Jacques Clément.</p>

<p>Everywhere there was a hideous admixture of blood and
superstition. The great nobles employed hired assassins and
duellists, who killed each other as a pastime, without remorse
or pity; every day two were pitted against two, four against
four, a hundred against a hundred; and the address of an
assassin or poisoner could then be as easily procured as that
of an hotel-keeper in the present day.</p>

<p>As a last instance, the assassin, the regicide, Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Clément, was canonized from all the pulpits as “<em>the most
blessed child of Dominique, the holy martyr of Jesus Christ</em>.”
His portrait was placed on the altars with these words:
“<em>Saint Jacques Clément, pray for us.</em>” When his mother
came to Paris, the nuns addressed her in the language of the
Evangelist: “Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the
paps which thou hast sucked.” And Pope Sixtus V., more
infamous still, declared in full consistory, that the action of
the martyr Jacques Clément might be compared, as regarded
the safety of the world, to the incarnation and resurrection
of Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>A church that has uttered such blasphemies by the mouth
of its chief, should for ever seek pardon both from God and
man. It should moreover bless that principle of tolerance,
which has imposed upon it both the Reformation and philosophy;
for it is this alone, which prevents its relapse into
the degraded condition of former times.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BII_XVIII">XVIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Religion was but a secondary matter in the war between
Henry IV. and the League, and in the other events of this
epoch. We need not relate them, since they belong to
the general history of the country, and not to our special
subject.</p>

<p>Thirty years earlier, the advent of a Calvinist prince to
the throne of France would perhaps have made the Reformed
the dominant religion; but in 1589 all was changed. Far
from deriving advantage, the affairs of the Reformed were
compromised by the event. Henry of Navarre, as lieutenant
of Henry III., could dictate his own conditions; it was
necessary that as king, he should accept those of the (Roman)
Catholics. He had their desertion to dread, whilst
he did not fear that he should be abandoned by his co-religionists.
He therefore did little for his own party, but
much for that of his adversaries, according to that old court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
maxim, that “enemies should be gratified at the expense of
those friends whose support may be depended upon.”</p>

<p>Before taking an oath of fidelity, the (Roman) Catholic
nobles demanded that he should again enter the communion
of the Romish church. It was the Marquis d’O, superintendent
of the finances, who conveyed to him this message—a
singular choice for a religious mission! This former creature
of Henry III., one of the most contemptible and despised of
men, had disgusted the courtiers themselves by the barefaced
double-dealing of his language and conduct. He, however,
protested in the name of the nobility, that he would rather
throw himself upon his sword than allow (Roman) Catholicism
to be ruined in France.</p>

<p>Henry IV. refused to change his religion all at once.
“Would it be more agreeable to you,” said he to the (Roman)
Catholic nobles, “to have a king without a God? Could you
place confidence in the faith of an atheist? And in the day
of battle would you follow the banner of a perjurer and an
apostate with alacrity?” After long discussions he only
promised that he would seek instruction during the next six
months.</p>

<p>These words were regarded in two very different ways.
The promise of seeking instruction seemed to the (Roman)
Catholics equivalent to his re-entering the pale of the church
of Rome; to the Reformed, on the contrary, it appeared
that they only related to the duty of examining anew the
points of controversy and the sincere adoption of the side of
truth. As to Henry IV. it appears that he had already
determined to become instructed, not by the doctors, but by
the course of events.</p>

<p>At the end of some weeks, his army was almost dissolved.
Of forty thousand men he only retained from six to seven
thousand, and was compelled to fall back upon Normandy.
The Duke d’Epernon and other (Roman) Catholic chiefs,
retired with their troops, on the ground that they could not
serve under a Huguenot chief. Those who remained, demanded
that their aid should be paid for by great personal
favours. The Calvinist chiefs were more faithful and less
exacting. Among them were the Duke de Bouillon, sovereign
of the principality of Sédan; François de Châtillon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
son of the Admiral Coligny; the Duke Claude de la Trémoille,
Jacques Caumont de la Force, Agrippa d’Aubigné,
Lanoue, Rosny, and Mornay. The last held a high position
in the confidence of his master.</p>

<p>Philippe de Mornay, lord of Plessis, was born at the
castle of Buhi, in the old French Vexin, in 1549, and was
brought up by his mother in the doctrines of the Reformation.
He had not attained the age of twelve years, when
he replied to a priest who cautioned him against Lutheran
opinions: “I am determined to remain firm in what I have
learned in the service of God, and when I shall have doubts
upon any point, I will diligently read the Evangelists and
the Acts of the Apostles.”</p>

<p>His uncle, the bishop of Nantes, and afterwards archbishop
of Rheims, advised him to study the Fathers of the
Church, and offered him, with the revenue of a rich abbey,
the prospect of becoming his successor. Mornay read the
Fathers, who, far from estranging him from his faith, confirmed
him in it; and he said to his uncle on refusing the
abbey: “I trust in God for what I shall want.”</p>

<p>In after-life he did not belie the disinterestedness of his
youth. Animated by strong and firm convictions, modest in
prosperity, patient in adversity, always ready to risk his property
and his life in the service of his faith, Duplessis-Mornay
has displayed to the world one of the greatest and most
upright characters that ever honoured the Christian church.
He has been called the pope of the Huguenots; it would
have been better to have said that he was their model.</p>

<p>His talents equalled his piety. A warrior, a doctor of
theology, a counsellor, diplomatist, orator and author, a skilful
writer, working fourteen hours a day, and displaying an
equal superiority in the most opposite pursuits, it would be
difficult to indicate one order of merit, in which he did
not excel, if we except the talent of advancing his own
fortunes.</p>

<p>Escaped as by a miracle from the massacre of Saint Bartholomew,
Mornay took refuge in England, where he met with
a gracious reception from Queen Elizabeth. The Duke
d’Anjou, on becoming king of Poland, wishing to give a
proof of his tolerant intentions towards the Polish Protestants,
offered Mornay a place in his council; but he answered:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
“I will never enter the service of those, who have
shed the blood of my brethren.”</p>

<p>The invitation of the Béarnese king was better responded
to. Mornay joined this prince, who was then poor and
weak, at his small court at Agen; and these two men, so
different in character, habit, and conduct, contracted a
friendship, which was on more than one occasion interrupted,
but never entirely destroyed. Henry stood in need of
Mornay, of his prudence, his devotion, and even of his severity;
and Mornay, notwithstanding his reproaches, saw in
his master a man who had been raised by Heaven to defend
the cause of the Reformation.</p>

<p>His functions at the court of Agen and Nérac were as
multifarious as his genius was versatile. During the less
important wars, which were continually springing up between
Henry III. and the Béarnese king, he acted at
different times as captain, engineer, camp-master, and chief
financier of the army; and instead of gaining by these employments,
he more frequently contributed to the cause.
When in the tent, he would take his pen and draw up diplomatic
notes, memorials, manifestoes, replies to the (Roman)
Catholics, and remonstrances to the Reformed, with admirable
promptitude. In council he prepared the speeches of
the king of Navarre, and furnished him with suitable arguments
to satisfy men of jealous or suspicious temperament.</p>

<p>He visited the court of France in order to defend the interests
of his co-religionists. Henry III. asked him one day,
how a man of his science and capacity could be a Huguenot;
“Have you never read,” he asked, “the Catholic doctors?” “I
have not only read the Catholic doctors,” was Mornay’s reply,
“but I have read them with earnestness; for I am flesh and
blood, like another man, and was not born without ambition.
I should have been very glad to have discovered what would
have quieted my conscience, in order that I might have participated
in the wealth and honours which you distribute,
and from the enjoyment of which my religion excludes me.
But everywhere I have found arguments to fortify my
belief; and worldly considerations should always yield to
those of conscience.” Noble words, and passing strange to
have been spoken at the court of the Valois, and of Catherine
de Medicis!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>After the death of Henry III. Mornay was, near
Henry IV., as the organ of those whose faith was the most
decided, and whose intentions were the purest of the Consistorial
Reformed.</p>

<p>The Baron de Rosny, afterwards Duke de Sully, represented
the political Calvinistic party, or those who advocated
measures of compromise. A great minister of state, an able
and upright financier, he repaired, more than any other person,
the unhappy consequences of the civil wars under the reign
of Henry IV.; and if the people measured glory by benefits,
his should be immense. He would also display a manly
courage when it became necessary, to hinder the king from
compromising the dignity of his crown by his weaknesses.
But in matters of religion his convictions were not strong,
and without leaving the Reformed church himself, he powerfully
contributed to its being abandoned by his king. “He
was,” says a French historian, “one of those strong-minded
men, who place themselves above all prejudices where the service
of God is concerned; so that his religion consisted only
of superficial forms.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The old Huguenot chiefs were assembled round Henry IV.
at the battle of Ivry in large numbers, and he remembered
in the hour of danger the lessons of his pious mother.
Lifting up his eyes to heaven, he called God to witness his
right: “But, O Lord,” said he, “if it has pleased Thee to
order otherwise, or if I should be one of those kings whom
Thou givest in Thy wrath, take my life with my crown, and
may my blood be the last shed in this quarrel.”</p>

<p>The battle was gained. The Calvinists, nevertheless,
remained in an unsettled and critical position. With no
legal security, they maintained, in fact, simple possession of
those places where they were strong enough to defend themselves,
but they held nothing by law. No edict, given in
regular form, had abolished the decrees of extermination
pronounced against them. The Parliaments could, by the
terms of these ordinances, decree that the Calvinists could
be taken, judged, and condemned to banishment or capital
punishment. The king celebrated the Reformed worship in
his camp; at two leagues’ distance it was punished as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
crime. Duplessis summed up their position in two words:
“They had the halter always round their necks.”</p>

<p>Many complained of this; and seeing that their requests
were received with disdain, they proposed, at a meeting convened
at Saint Jean d’Angély, to choose another protector
for the Church. Henry IV. was much distressed at this
course; but the faithful Mornay replied to him by energetic
representations: “What! is it not intended to revoke the
edicts of proscription, and yet do they counsel the Reformed
to be patient? Have they not been patient during fifty
years? and does the service of the king require that they
should be patient in things of this nature? Ought not
children to be baptized? shall not marriages be consecrated?
Each hour’s delay brings troubles and sufferings. If three
families pray together for the prosperity of the king, if an
artisan sings a psalm in his shop, or should a bookseller sell
a French Bible, here are grounds for persecuting decrees.
Our judges answer that such is the law. Well! let the law
be changed. To such evils prompt remedies should be
applied.”</p>

<p>The king knew that it would be doubly perilous for him
to persist in his denial of justice; from within, because the
Reformed at length sought other protection than his own;
from without, because the Protestant powers would refuse
him their aid. He therefore caused an edict of toleration to
be adopted at his council, in the month of July, 1591, known
as that of Nantes, which reinstated the Reformed in the
same position which they held in 1577; a very meagre concession,
since no more was granted than had been given by
Henry III. Moreover, this ordinance did not pass without
difficulty, and was never well observed, especially in those
matters which related to admission to public employment.</p>

<p>We may judge from the following occurrence what was
the amount of fanaticism which reigned in the camp even of
Henry IV. Several Calvinists having been killed at the
siege of Rouen, had been buried indiscriminately with the
bodies of (Roman) Catholics, but the priests caused the
bodies to be disinterred, and ordered that they should be
thrown as food to the beasts of the field. Thus, men who
had fought under the same banner were not permitted to
sleep together in the same dust.</p>

<p>The League, however, in proportion as it felt its strength
decreasing, redoubled its violence. It had called to Paris
bands of Spanish and Neapolitan soldiers and preachers, and
with obscene or atrocious language, had demanded millions
of heads. The prior of the Sorbonne, Jean Boucher, taught
that it was necessary to take the knife in hand to kill and
exterminate all; the bishop Rose argued that another bleeding
like that of Saint Bartholomew was again necessary, and
that by such means the disease would be cut short; the
Jesuit Commolet said that the death of the politicians was
life to the (Roman) Catholics; and the curé of Saint André
asserted that he would march foremost to slay them.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory XIV. at the same time sent monitions to
the (Roman) Catholics of France, threatening with severe
pains those who had taken the oath of fidelity to Henry of
Béarn, the heretic and the excommunicated. These bulls,
which were worthy of the age of Robert the Devout, appeared
so monstrous, that the Parliaments of Tours and
Châlons, having declared them scandalous, seditious, and
contrary to the rights of the Gallican church, caused them
to be burned by the hands of the executioner.</p>

<p>But the six months, at the expiration of which Henry IV.
had promised to make himself acquainted [with the difference
of the two creeds], had long since expired. He had
been in the field nearly four years without having made
any sensible progress in this respect. All the (Roman)
Catholics who had attached themselves to his fortunes, pressed
him warmly to change his religion; the bishops, because
they were blamed at Rome, and were desirous of freeing
themselves from the reproach of infidelity; the nobility, because
they were impatient to receive the reward of their
services; the members of the Parliament, no less than those
of the privy council, because they better understood state
exigencies than conscientious scruples. The greater number
of the other portions of society felt disposed to content themselves
with form only; it was sufficient for them that they
could tell the populace that the king of France attended mass.</p>

<p>The Abbé Duperron, afterwards bishop of Evreux and
cardinal, an intriguing and cunning person, as well as an eloquent
orator, spoke with these views to Henry IV., introducing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
into his arguments few theological, but many political
considerations.</p>

<p>Gabrielle d’Estrées added to this the weight of a more
direct and more intimate influence. She had no love for the
Calvinists, who had frequently addressed severe expressions
to her. The Béarnese, moreover, vanquished by fond passion,
had led her to see in perspective the half of a throne. But
to re-marry, it became necessary to be unmarried, and this,
without exciting scandal, the pope alone could permit.</p>

<p>The king himself, whose “soul was steeped in voluptuousness,”
according to the energetic expression of a contemporary,
and who never had any solid religious principles, waited
only for the proper time and opportunity. The single question
for him, since his accession to the throne, was to abjure
wisely, that is to say, that in gaining the (Roman) Catholics
he might not lose the Reformed.</p>

<p>Among these, many of the nobility, wearied with war,
showed themselves well disposed. Sully set them the example.
“That I should advise you to attend mass,” said he
to Henry IV., “is a thing you should not, as I think, expect
from me, being of another religion; but I tell you frankly,
that it is the most prompt and easy mode of overturning all
these malignant projects. You will no longer have to encounter
so many enemies, troubles, and difficulties in this
world; as to the other,” he continued, laughing, “I will not
answer for that.” On which the king laughed also.</p>

<p>Sully relates, in his “<cite lang="fr">Economies Royales</cite>,” how he had conceived
a theory, which admitted of passing in conscientious
security from the Reformed communion to the Roman
(Catholic) church. The king having caused him to be called
very early one morning, requested him to sit down near his
bed, and demanded his advice. Sully at first invoked political
reasons, and as “the king was scratching his head in
great perplexity,” he continued in these terms: “I hold it to
be infallible, that of whatever kind of religion men make an
external profession, if they die having observed the Decalogue,
with a belief in the Apostles’ Creed, if they love God
with all their heart, are charitable towards their neighbour,
hope in the mercy of God, and to obtain redemption by the
death, the merit, and the righteousness of Jesus Christ, they
cannot fail to be saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>It was thus that Henry IV. became furnished with his
famous argument of the most safe course, the (Roman) Catholics
affirming that there was no safety out of their communion,
and the Calvinists admitting that it is possible to
be saved out of theirs. It will be seen at the first glance
that the question had been improperly stated by Sully; it
was a matter not of faith only, but of good faith; and when
in speaking of dying in the observance of the Decalogue,
which forbids us to bear false witness, he advised the king
to commit an act of fraud and hypocrisy, one-half of his
argument overturned the other half. Clearly it could only
carry conviction to a mind already convinced by reasoning
of a totally different nature.</p>

<p>Duplessis gave opposite advice, for he had seriously taken
up the instruction of the king. He was desirous that the
several points of religion should be discussed before him by
the most celebrated doctors, and of recommencing in some
manner the conference of Poissy. He invited each of the
principal theologians of the Reformation to study one of the
questions of controversy, in order that they might all come
well armed before their adversaries. Henry IV., “the most
cunning, and the most subtle prince in the world,” as Agrippa
d’Aubigné, who had lived thirty years in his confidence,
called him, permitted Mornay to take his own course, and
enjoined him even to select his champions without delay.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic nobles were deceived by this, and
offered Mornay twenty thousand crowns on condition that
he should not again awaken the king’s scruples. “The conscience
of my master is no more to be sold,” said he to them,
“than my own!” A beautiful reply, but unhappily only
true on one side.</p>

<p>Despairing of being able to seduce Mornay, the politicians
prayed Henry IV. to remove him from his person. But
coming upon them unexpectedly at one of their meetings,
“It is hard, gentlemen,” said he, “to prevent a master from
speaking to a faithful servant. The proposals which I make
to him are of such a nature that I can state them to him
aloud, before you all. I propose to him that he should serve
God with a good conscience, that he should have Him constantly
before his eyes in every action, that he should appease
the schism which is in the state, by a sacred reformation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the Church; that he should be an example to all Christians
and to all posterity. Are these things to be said in secret?
Would you wish that I should counsel him to attend mass?
You do him wrong to imagine that he would profit by doing
so. With what conscience can I advise him, if I do not
first go there myself? and what religion is that which we
may throw off like our shirts?”</p>

<p>Astonished by so much courage and virtue, Marshal
d’Aumont cried, “You are more estimable than we are,
Monsieur Duplessis; and if I said, two days since, that it
was necessary to shoot you through the head, I say to-day,
on the contrary, that you merit a statue.”</p>

<p>It will be surprising that the judicious Mornay, who had
so closely and for so long a time observed the king, should
have entertained so good an opinion of his firmness. But
he had the sublime ingenuousness of men of great faith; and
moreover, Henry IV. displayed in this matter—it is with
regret that we say so of the most popular of the French
kings—the most consummate duplicity. He went so far
as to invite the Reformed of France to fast, and pray that
God would bless the pretended conferences, which were
about to be opened; and he said to the pastors assembled
at Saumur, “If you learn that I have committed some
excess, you may believe that there is some foundation in the
report, for I am a man subject to great infirmities; but if
they should tell you that I have been seduced from my
religion, do not believe it; I would die first.” Three months
afterwards he abjured at Saint Denis.</p>

<p>On the 22nd July, 1593, the archbishop of Bourges and
other dignitaries of the (Roman) Catholic clergy, repaired to
the king. It had been arranged that they alone should
speak. We meet with a curious proof of this from a letter
in which the bishop of Chartres was informed, that “he might
come in full confidence, without troubling himself about
theology.” For greater safety, Mornay had been sent away.</p>

<p>At a later period, Henry IV. explained the exclusion of
the ministers by the following position. His mind was
made up beforehand, he said. Why, then, expose the advocates
of the Reformation to a certain defeat? Had they
attended the conference, the bishops would have boasted of
having vanquished them; in not attending, the ministers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
preserved the right of saying that they had not been heard.
It is thus that sometimes the most serious matters are dealt
with in this world.</p>

<p>On the 23rd July, the archbishop of Bourges delivered a
discourse before the king, which lasted from six until eleven
o’clock in the morning. The Béarnese only interrupted it
from time to time, in order to ask for some explanation; or,
if he raised an objection, he took care to add that he submitted
himself entirely to the authority of the (Roman)
Catholic church—conduct more worthy of a mocking philosopher
than of a king. It was a ceremony arranged beforehand.
Henry IV. had written to Gabrielle d’Estrées: “I
commence this morning to speak to the bishops. It will be
to-morrow that I shall make the perilous leap.”</p>

<p>An act of abjuration had been prepared, in which the
king rejected, one after the other, all the doctrines of the
Reformed faith. But he would not sign it, and they [the
clergy] were contented with a vague adhesion in six lines to
the articles of the Roman church. Nevertheless, by a cheat,
very much resembling an act of forgery, and which paints the
manners of the age, Loménie counterfeited the king’s signature
on the first of the two formularies which it became
necessary to send to the pope.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 25th July, 1593, at eight o’clock in the
morning, the king presented himself at the great gate of the
church of Saint Denis, accompanied by the princes and the
officers of the crown. At the entrance were the prelates,
who awaited his arrival with the cross, the book of the
Evangelists, and holy water. “Who are you?” said the
archbishop of Bourges. “I am the king.” “What do you
demand?” “I demand to be received within the pale of the
Catholic, apostolic, and Roman church.” “Do you desire it
<em>sincerely</em>?” “Yes, I wish it and desire it.” Then kneeling,
he pronounced the formulary agreed upon, and the archbishop
gave him absolution, and the benediction. The priests
sang a grand mass, and at the termination of the ceremony,
Cardinal de Bourbon carried to the king the book of the
Evangelists to kiss.</p>

<p>This is what has been termed the conversion of Henry
IV.—a matter of policy, through the influence of women, a
lie of the priests, and a falsehood from beginning to end!</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<h3 id="BII_XX">XX.</h3>
</div>


<p>The act of abjuration did not immediately bring back the
Leaguers to submission. The Spanish ambassador distributed
gold with lavish hands. The legate pretended that to the
pope alone belonged the right of reconciling one, who had
been excommunicated by the Church, and the States-General
of the League swore to obey the decrees of the Holy See.
Boucher delivered nine sermons against the simulated conversion
of the Béarnese, saying that the bishops of St. Denis
were traitors, their prayers anathemas, and the mass sung
before the heretics a miserable farce. All the preachers of
the faction of the Sixteen (<i lang="fr">de la faction des seize</i>) declared
openly for regicide; and the fruit of their provocation was
soon apparent. Jean Banière in 1593, and the year following
Jean Châtel, attempted to assassinate the king. A
decree of the Parliament drove the society of Loyola from
the kingdom; it returned to give birth to Ravaillac.</p>

<p>But the mass of the nation accepted the abjuration of
Henry IV. as real and sincere, because it thirsted for repose.
The chiefs of the League, having lost all hope of vanquishing,
now only thought of selling themselves as dearly as
possible. It cost the king enormous sums, and the Reformed
were nearly everywhere sacrificed in the capitulations.
Rouen, Meaux, Poitiers, Agen, Beauvais, Amiens, Saint
Malo, and many other cities, both large and small, stipulated,
in making submission, that the preaching of the Huguenots
should be banished from within their walls and their suburbs.
Paris claimed an extension of the interdict to ten leagues
from its gates. The king opposed some resistance to these
demands, but he finished by granting all of them.</p>

<p>The least mark of attachment which the Béarnese might
show towards his old co-religionists, was watched with an
eye of jealousy, and he was unable openly to press the hand
of those faithful servants, who had defended his crown at the
expense of their blood.</p>

<p>A new <em>protector</em> was again begun to be spoken of, notwithstanding
the energetic expressions of Henry IV., who
called himself the natural and legitimate protector of his
subjects. Duplessis loyally supported the remonstrances of
the king; however, he, in his turn, preferred to him heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
complaints: “See, sire,” he wrote to him, “by what steps
you have been conducted to the mass. Those, who do not
believe in God, have made you swear by images and relics,
purgatory and indulgences. Your poor subjects see you go
further still, by this same road. They see you send to make
your submission to Rome. They know that there cannot
be absolution without penance. The pope, on the first
opportunity, will send you the sacred sword, and will impose
upon you the law of making war against heretics; and under
this name will be comprehended the most Christian and the
most loyal of the French.”</p>

<p>Clement VIII., in truth, demanded as the price of absolution,
the abrogation of the edicts of toleration, the exclusion
of heretics from all offices, and the promise of exterminating
them, so soon as peace should be concluded with the League
and with Spain. On this occasion Henry IV. rebelled. He
caused a reply to be returned by D’Ossat and Duperron, to
the effect that he should be accused of indecency and ingratitude,
if, after having experienced so many services from
those of the (Reformed) religion, he reduced them to extremity,
and forced them to take arms against his person.</p>

<p>The pope and the king, by the aid of equivocation, finished
with a mutual understanding, and on the 16th September,
1595, the two ambassadors of Henry IV. were kneeling under
the portico of Saint Peter. They sang the <i lang="fr">Miserere</i>, and
at each verse they received for their master blows from a rod
or switch, on the shoulders. The Spaniards ridiculed them,
and the more estimable of the French papists were indignant
at this humiliation.</p>

<p>The king continued to give the Reformed nothing but fair
words. He told them privately that he trusted in them
more than in the others, and he endeavoured even to justify
the privileges which he had granted to the (Roman) Catholics,
by the parable of the prodigal son, for whom the father
caused the fatted calf to be killed: “It is well,” replied the
deputies of the churches, “but treat us also as the son who
has always been faithful, and to whom the father said, ‘All
my goods are thine.’ To despoil the obedient son of his
legitimate rights, in order to give them to him who has
trodden underfoot the paternal authority, is not the spirit of
Christ’s parable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>To this the king could only reply by new exhortations to
patience. “You shall have satisfaction,” said he to them,
“when I am master at home.” Truly it was very difficult to
exercise patience in the unhappy condition of the Reformed.
Excluded from all offices, maltreated, persecuted, without
anywhere being able to invoke the Almighty in peace, without
security in their own houses, having no longer their
ancient protector, and forbidden to name another, they at
length resolved, with the tacit authority of the king, to
manage their own affairs, and convoked political assemblies.
The first was held at Sainte Foy, in the month of May,
1594.</p>

<p>These assemblies must not be confounded with the synods.
In the synods, the clergy and laity were equal in number, and
were always occupied with the interests of the Church. In
the political assemblies, the laity were greatly in the majority,
and they treated also concerning state affairs.</p>

<p>Assemblies of this kind had been held during the religious
wars, but they then took a more regular organization, and
adopted the plan of uniting at periodical intervals.</p>

<p>France was divided into ten departments, each of which
named a deputy to form the <em>General Council</em>. Their distinction
of three orders was borrowed from the States-General.
The General Council was to be composed of four noblemen,
four members of the Third Estate, and of two pastors.
When the number of members was raised to thirty, there
were twelve delegates of the nobility, twelve representatives
of the Third Estate, and six clergymen. The president was
to be a layman, the vice-president an ecclesiastic. One half
of the council was re-elected every six months. Dukes,
lieutenant-generals, and other personages of high rank, took
part in the deliberations without being deputies, provided
they were not objected to by the assembly.</p>

<p>The provincial councils were next in authority to the
General Council, and were composed of from five to seven
members, chosen equally from the three orders. They were
to include at least one resident governor and a clergyman.</p>

<p>These councils were to promote peace between those of
their own religion, to levy rates for the necessities of the cause,
and to regulate the disposal of them, to watch over the stores
and munitions of fortified towns; in a word, to do everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
that was necessary for the defence of their common interests.
The deputies took the oath of obedience, and the members
of the Church were obliged to respect the decisions of the
general and private assemblies. A permanent fund of forty-five
thousand crowns was supplied by the contributions of
the faithful.</p>

<p>The General Council received memorials and complaints
from the provincial councils, sent them to court, discussed
the terms of the new edicts with the commissioners of the
king, and sought to establish the free exercise of religion
upon a more solid basis.</p>

<p>Judging according to present ideas, nothing could be more
contrary to good order than this organization; it was, as we
have already remarked, a state within a state. But to appreciate
as we ought the institution of these political assemblies,
we must recollect that the Reformed were excluded
in France from the common right. The intolerant dogmas
of (Roman) Catholicism did not recognise them as Frenchmen.
They were looked upon as foreigners, or rather as
enemies, and were treated as such. The king was obliged
to capitulate with some of his subjects at the expense of the
others. The pope demanded their extermination. The
bishops had forced Henry to say at his coronation, “I will,
in good faith, do all in my power to drive all heretics,
denounced by the Church, out of my jurisdiction and territory;”
and this was only a mitigated formula, that the priests
had sanctioned after much hesitation. Public authority
attacked and condemned the Reformed as malefactors. If
then they established a distinct society amongst themselves,
it is because they were cut off from society in general; and it
would be absurd, as well as odious, to accuse those in the
name of the law, who had been put out of its pale.</p>

<p>The Leaguers had also formed a state within the state,
but with this difference, that they were associated together
in order to oppress the Calvinists, whilst the latter united
that they might not be oppressed; and cruel experience
proved to them, under the reign of Louis XIV., that in losing
their political organization, they were exposed to the loss of
everything.</p>

<p>The council of the king heard with astonishment of the
decision of the assembly of Sainte Foy. It had imagined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
that the great Calvinist body, deprived of its ancient protector,
would be destroyed. Catherine of Medicis and
Charles IX. fell into the same error after the massacre of
Saint Bartholomew. Seeing the Reformed rise up under the
strokes of persecution to take a firmer attitude than ever,
statesmen began to think that it was necessary to temporize
with them.</p>

<p>The king feigned to be discontented, but secretly encouraged
the political assemblies. He preferred them to a protector,
who might have made himself too conspicuous in the
kingdom, and he made use of them with the Leaguers, and
even with his advisers at Rome, to grant more favourable
conditions to his former friends. The Edict of Nantes, one
of the most glorious acts of Henry IV., would never have
been agreed to in council, nor registered by Parliament, if it
had not been for the assemblies of the Reformed.</p>

<p>The negotiations were long, laborious, and intermixed with
incidents which would offer little or no interest [to be here
related]. Political assemblies were held at Saumur, Loudun,
and Vendôme, and again at Saumur and Châtellerault in the
years 1595, 1596, and 1597. The court addressed them with
menaces or words of encouragement, according to circumstances.
Commissioners were appointed to treat with the
Calvinists; but they only possessed limited powers, and even
within these limits they were not authorized to conclude a
definitive arrangement. There was a perpetual interchange
of communications, much playing at cross-purpose, between
the two parties; some were only willing to grant the Edict
of Poitiers, with amendments of no importance; others
demanded the full and free exercise of their religion; the
former alleging state reasons, the latter principles of justice
and conscience.</p>

<p>In the midst of these sterile disputes, persecution continued
to be violent in some places, and vexatious in others.
At Châtaigneraie, upon the confines of Poitou and Brittany,
the Leaguers, encouraged by the Duc de Mercœur, had fallen
suddenly upon the faithful, whilst they were at prayers, in
1595. Two hundred persons, of every age, men and women,
had been cowardly butchered. It was a repetition of the
massacre at Vassy.</p>

<p>Amongst the victims was an infant brought to be baptized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
A poor boy, eight years of age, in the simplicity of his heart,
offered eightpence, the contents of his little purse, in the
hope of ransoming his life; but the murderers loved his blood
better; whilst the Lady of Châtaigneraie afterwards amused
herself with the butchers in counting the dead.</p>

<p>This cold-blooded butchery revolted even the most violent
of Henry IV.’s advisers, and the authors of the massacre
were expressly exempted in cases of amnesty. Nevertheless,
it may be seen in a publication of 1597, under the title, <cite>Complaints
of the Reformed Churches of France</cite>, how much oppression,
injustice, and violence, had to be submitted to. These
grievances would alone fill a volume; but we will only cite a
few examples.</p>

<p>The Reformed were forbidden the free exercise of their
religion throughout such provinces as Burgundy and Picardy;
they had but a solitary place of worship in Brittany, and two
in Provence; they were ill-treated, stoned, or thrown into the
river on their return from worship; cannons were fired
against their meetings; the king’s own sister was constrained
to set out for Rouen, to take the sacrament, because the
legate disapproved of her receiving it in the city; Bibles
and the Book of Psalms were burnt by the hand of the
executioner; they were forbidden to comfort the sick; and
at Saint Quentin, for example, a man was outlawed for
having relieved one infected with the plague in the street;
children were carried off or baptized by force in the houses
by priests, accompanied by officers of justice. The curate of
Saint Etienne starved an old man in prison to extort an
abjuration, and forced him to sign a deed in the presence of
a notary, by which he condemned himself to banishment if
he renounced the (Roman) Catholic faith; cities, given as
hostages, were taken away or ransacked; the poor were neglected
and driven away, even where the Reformed contributed
the most to the common fund; there was systematic
exclusion from all appointments, even from the magistracy
of the city, from the freedom of companies, from the offices
of notary and attorney; there was no justice before the
tribunals; exorbitant fines and imprisonments [were inflicted]
for the slightest cause; [as well as] disinterment of the dead,
even of those who had been buried in the tombs of their
ancestors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>In terminating this long list of grievances, the Reformed
said to the king, “But, sire, we have amongst us neither
Jacobins nor Jesuits, who aim at your life, nor Leaguers, who
desire your crown. We have never presented the points of
our swords instead of petitions. We are paid by political
considerations. They tell us the time is not yet come for
granting an edict. And this, great God, after thirty-five
years of persecutions, ten years of banishment by the edicts
of the League, eight years of the king’s reign, and four years’
entreaty. We only ask of your majesty an edict which
would permit us to enjoy that which is common to all your
subjects. The glory of God, the safety of our property and
lives, would be the summit of our wishes and the end of our
petitions.”</p>

<p>The king and his council were again for temporizing with
them; however, the fresh dangers which menaced the kingdom,
the surprise of Amiens by the Spaniards, the resolution
of many Huguenot noblemen to remain inactive, instead of
drawing their swords for a king who had abandoned them,
the conscience of many of their most celebrated men, which
at last began to trouble them, caused the Edict of Nantes to
be granted in the month of April, 1598, which took its name
from the place where it was first published.</p>

<p>In the preamble of this celebrated act, the king acknowledged
that God is adored and worshipped by all his subjects,
if not in the same form, at least with the same intentions, in
such manner that his kingdom will always merit and preserve
the glorious title of “very Christian.” The edict was
declared perpetual and irrevocable, as being the principal
foundation of the union and tranquillity of the state.</p>

<p>This great charter of the French Reformation briefly consisted
of what follows under the ancient <i lang="fr">régime</i>—entire
liberty of conscience in the domestic circle; the public exercise
of religion in all places where it was established in 1597,
and in the suburbs of the towns; permission to lords of high
rank to have service performed in their castles, and to noblemen
of second rank, the right of admitting thirty persons to
their private worship; the admission of the Reformed to
public employment, of their children to the schools, of their
invalids to the hospitals, of their poor to partake of the alms;
the right of printing their books in certain towns; equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
representation in some of the Parliaments; a chamber of the
edict at Paris, entirely composed of (Roman) Catholics, except
a single member, but offering sufficient guarantee by its particular
object; four academies for scientific and theological
instruction; authorization to convoke synods according to
discipline; and lastly, a certain number of places of surety.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic church had also its share in this
edict. The property of the clergy was to be everywhere
restored, tithes paid, and the exercise of (Roman) Catholicism
re-established throughout the kingdom. This last article,
which restored the mass in two hundred and fifty towns, and
two thousand country parishes, narrowly missed exciting an
insurrection at La Rochelle.</p>

<p>Yet this was not religious liberty, nor even simple toleration,
as we understand it now; it was still a treaty of peace
between two people juxtaposed upon the same soil. There
was a twofold law; there were two armies, two judicial
establishments, and each party had its places of hostage.
Henry IV., the head of the whole state, had filled the office
of arbitrator between the two camps. But this was already
a great step in advance of the past.</p>

<p>The false maxim that there should be only one faith, as
there are only one king and one government, had cost
France three millions of actual money, and two millions of
men. It had erected the scaffold and the stake during sixty
years, kindled civil war during thirty-five years, provoked
the massacres of Mérindol, of Vassy, and of Saint Bartholomew,
and inspired spoliations and murders, and crimes without
number. At the termination of the wars, half of the
towns and castles were in ashes, commerce destroyed, and
the country so devastated that thousands of the peasantry
had resolved to emigrate, having no longer the wherewithal
to live upon the soil which had nourished their forefathers.</p>

<p>Humanity has achieved the principle of religious liberty
through rivers of blood and over heaps of ruins: it has been
too dearly purchased to be lost.</p>

<span class="fs60">FROM THE PROMULGATION TO THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES.<br>
(1598-1685.)</span></h2>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_I">I.</h3>
</div>

<p>The compromise between the two religious communions
met with the approval of good men; but it was slow in
passing from the law into the ideas and manners [of the
people].</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic clergy made the strongest protestations
against the Edict of Nantes, and Clement VIII. wrote
to say that “a decree, which gave <em>liberty of conscience to all,
was the most accursed that had ever been made</em>.” The
university, governed by the Sorbonne and the Jesuits, wished
to close the gates of the colleges against the Huguenots; and
several Parliaments even raised serious obstacles against the
registration of the edict.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, passions died away; and in spite
of the quarrels, which were inevitable after such cruel conflicts,
the twelve years which elapsed from the promulgation
of the edict to the death of the king, form one of the most
tranquil epochs of the French Reformation. The old historians
express but one regret,—that the reign of Henry IV.
had not lasted twelve years longer, in order to have given
him time to perfect his work of reconciliation.</p>

<p>Proselytism, already confined within narrow limits by the
religious wars, almost entirely ceased after the edict, at least
on the part of the Calvinists. The (Roman) Catholics alone
continued to enlist a few adherents; but politics weighed
more in this cause than argument. Huguenot gentlemen
went through the Church of Rome in order to pass into the
antechambers of the court.</p>

<p>The priests wished above all things to gain over the
pastors. They even became generous in the cause, and upon
the authority of a papal brief, they raised a fund to produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
thirty thousand livres a year, for the purpose of giving
pensions to those ministers and professors, who should be
tempted to abjure. But no one could be found to draw
upon the purse of the clergy on such conditions.</p>

<p>From 1598 to 1610 the Calvinists entered little into
state affairs. The young Henry de Condé had been summoned
to Paris in 1595, on the promise that he should be
left to the enjoyment of the religion of his father. Scarcely,
however, had he arrived before he was placed in the hands
of zealous (Roman) Catholics, and he was not only converted,
but he became a <em>converter</em>. This prince rewarded his domestics
with fifteen sous every time they went to confess,
provided they brought him certificates in due form.</p>

<p>One single member of the family of the Bourbons, Catherine
of Navarre, sister of Henry IV., remained faithful to
the religion of Jeanne d’Albret. She manifested a singular
constancy; and upon a false report that she had been to
mass, wrote to Mornay—“I shall go there when you become
pope.”</p>

<p>She pursued her devotional exercises at Saint Germain-en-Laye,
after the entry of Henry IV. into Paris, in order to
avoid altercations. But one day, having caused the marriage
of a niece of Coligny to be celebrated at the Louvre, and
having had for this occasion the doors thrown open during
the sermon, the priests bitterly complained. “You are
bold,” said the king to them, “to hold such language in my
house, and with reference to my sister.” “But a marriage
has been performed.” “Well, since it is over, what would
you have me do in the matter?”</p>

<p>This trifling incident serves to show how the clergy at
that time watched the Reformers with hostile eyes, tightening
their chain when it could be done, but never permitting
it to be loosened.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the Béarnese king ever set his
mind upon his sister’s abjuration, and he would even refer
the Calvinists to her, when he found it difficult to comply
with their requests. “Address yourselves to my sister,”
said he, laughing, to some gentlemen from Saintonge; “for
your state has fallen under the spindle.”</p>

<p>He desired in the end to marry her to the Duke de Bar,
of the house of Lorraine. This affair, of so little intrinsic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
importance, occupied the attention of the royal council, the
Holy See, and the synods for a long time. A disputation was
held before the princess between a doctor of the Sorbonne
and a professor of Sedan, which did not, however, result in
Catherine’s forsaking her faith. The pope refused to give a
dispensation for the marriage; the prelates, in their turn,
also refused to move any further; whilst the king, whom
these delays disgusted, conceived the idea of summoning his
natural brother, the archbishop of Rouen, to his cabinet, a
worldly priest, who consented to give the nuptial benediction.</p>

<p>The marriage was not a happy one. The sister of
Henry IV. had to suffer coldness and ill-treatment from the
Duke de Bar, who allowed himself to be wholly led by the
Jesuits. She died in 1604, and no Bourbon since that
time has belonged to the Reformed communion.</p>

<p>Some noblemen of high rank still endeavoured to draw
the Huguenots into their individual quarrels, but they
were not listened to. The Duke de Bouillon, among others,
who had been compromised in the conspiracy of Marshal
Biron, invited his co-religionists to come to his aid. “It is
necessary,” said he, “that the ministers and the churches,
altogether, without exception or distinction, should defend
this very just and important cause.” Some gentlemen rose
at his call, but the majority did not respond to it. The
freedom, guaranteed by the Edict of Nantes, satisfied the
Consistorialists, and the others could effect nothing without
them.</p>

<p>If some political assemblies continued to meet, it was
only every third year. They sometimes consisted of seventy
members, namely, thirty gentlemen, twenty delegates of the
<i lang="fr">Tiers-parti</i>, and twenty pastors. They displayed no spirit of
faction, and commonly confined themselves to drawing up
statements of grievances, and to naming two general deputies
for the protection of the interests of the churches at court.</p>

<p>The king, without absolutely interdicting these meetings,
took umbrage at them, and, through Sully, expressed his
sentiments to the assembly of Châtellerault. “If Henry IV.,”
answered the delegates, “were immortal, we, content with his
word in everything respecting ourselves, would instantly
renounce the thought of the slightest precaution; we would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
abandon our places of security; we would consider every
individual rule useless for the preservation of our society.
But the dread of finding different sentiments in one of his
successors” (was not their caution prophetic?) “compels us to
preserve the measures, which have been taken for our safety.”</p>

<p>The national synods also assembled in a more regular
manner than they had done hitherto. Five were held from
the Edict of Nantes to 1609. Pastors, elders, and the faithful,
each and all, understood that the exact observance of
the synodal system was essential to the prosperity of their
religion. There was no discussion, no circumstance of any
importance, that did not, either directly or by way of appeal,
come before this high tribunal, where local passions were
without influence with reference to the common interest.</p>

<p>One of the attributes of the national synods was to dole
out the <i lang="fr">deniers de l’octroi du roi</i>, or the king’s gift, among
the provinces and the academies, which amounted, or rather
ought to have amounted (for the funds were not very exactly
paid), to forty-five thousand crowns. A professor of theology
received seven hundred livres a year; a professor of Hebrew
or Greek, or of philosophy, four hundred livres; the regents
of the colleges, from one hundred and fifty to three hundred
livres. The academies, maintained by the synods, were
established at Montauban, Saumur, Nismes, Montpellier, and
Sédan; of these, the two first were the most flourishing.</p>

<p>A question, which greatly agitated these assemblies, and
became almost a state affair, was an article that was added,
in 1603, to the confession of faith by the national synod of
Gap, in which the Roman pontiff was accused of being
<em>Antichrist</em>. We cite this article as a monument of the ideas
and language of the times: “Since the bishop of Rome—having
erected a monarchy in Christendom, by grasping at
domination over all the churches and pastors—has raised
himself to the point of calling himself God, to seek to
be adored, to boast that he is all-powerful in heaven and on
earth, to dispose of all ecclesiastical matters, to decide upon
articles of faith, to authorize and interpret the Scriptures at
his pleasure; to traffic in souls, to dispense from vows and
oaths, to order new services to God; and, with reference to
government, to tread underfoot the legitimate authority of
magistrates, by taking away, giving, and exchanging kingdoms;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
we believe and maintain that he is properly the
<em>Antichrist</em> and the <em>son of perdition</em> prophesied of in the
Word of God, under the emblem of the scarlet woman....”</p>

<p>This article made a great noise. It followed upon some
theses with reference to the same subject, which had been
brilliantly supported by Jérémie Ferrier, a pastor of Nismes,
and submitted to the Parliament of Toulouse. The adhesion
of the national synod of Gap conferred much more
consequence upon them. The legate loudly complained;
the pope was extremely angry; the king expressed his
displeasure, saying that the decision of the synod threatened
to endanger the peace of the kingdom; and the ardent
(Roman) Catholics did not fail to represent this affair as a
personal insult to him, or even as an act of rebellion against
his crown.</p>

<p>A long and difficult negotiation ensued. At length the
national synod of La Rochelle, convoked in 1607, decided
that, though it unanimously approved of the contested
article, and held it to be conformable with what had been
predicted in the Scriptures, it consented, at the express
command of the sovereign, to omit it from the confession of
faith. In retaliation, it directed one of its members to
prove the justice of the accusation, and the pastor Vignier
acquitted himself of the commission in a book entitled, <cite>The
Theatre of Antichrist</cite>.</p>

<p>We must, to understand this perseverance, bear in mind,
that controversy was carried on at that time with extreme
bitterness. The pen and the tongue having replaced the
sword, passions, which had no longer another vent, were
brought into this new battle-field. The necessities of these
polemics were so great, that by a singular resolution, the
national synod of Saint Maixent distributed the most difficult
points of controversy among the provinces, with directions
to have them examined by persons capable of successfully
opposing, on all occasions, the (Roman) Catholic doctors.</p>

<p>This contest assumed sometimes considerable importance,
as was the case with the conference opened at Fontainebleau,
on the 14th of May, 1600, between Duplessis-Mornay and
Duperron.</p>

<p>Mornay, in a treatise upon the Eucharist, had collected
five or six thousand texts of the Fathers, which appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
to him opposed to the doctrine of transubstantiation. This
was, so to speak, the voice of the first centuries of Christianity,
which he summoned to testify against the inventions
of succeeding ages, and all the venerable doctors of the primitive
church rose one after the other, in his book, to protest
against the alteration of the Sacrament of the Supper.
This treatise was at the same time both a religious and
political event; and this is not to be wondered at, if we
reflect, on the one side, that the author had lived thirty
years in familiarity with the king; on the other, that the
dogma of the Eucharist was the great question of the era
between (Roman) Catholicism and the Reformation. It
was upon this point that the sentences of death pronounced
against the heretics had been principally founded, and
nothing contributed more, as we have seen, to break up
the colloquy of Poissy.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Medicis, legate of the pope, sent six
copies of Mornay’s work to Rome, promising to have it
refuted by Bellarmine. In place of a refutation, there came
despatches from Clement VIII. denouncing a new conspiracy
on the part of the heresy. Henry IV. was the more vexed
at this because he was then suing before the Holy See for a
divorce from his marriage with Marguérite de Valois. The
Parliaments also took part in the quarrel; and during a
whole winter, the pulpits of the old preachers of the League
re-echoed with violent anathemas against the audacious
adversary of the real presence.</p>

<p>Henry IV. made known his displeasure to Mornay, by
means of M. de la Force. “I have always regulated my
services,” answered Mornay, “according to the following
order—first to God, then to my king, next to my friends;
and I cannot, with a good conscience, change my method.”</p>

<p>However, Duperron, bishop of Evreux, said publicly, that
he had discovered in the tract “<em>more than five hundred enormous
falsehoods</em>,” and that he would undertake to prove
them [to be so]. The report of this having reached Mornay,
he accused this assertion of being an unworthy calumny, and
demanded the opportunity of <ins class="corr" id="tn-226" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'justify inghimself'">
justifying himself</ins> in a public conference.</p>

<p>At the single word “<em>public conference</em>,” the legate, the
bishop of Paris, the doctors of the Sorbonne raised an outcry;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
for the priests had generally been worsted in their oral
discussions with the theologians of the Reformation. “Rest
easy,” said the king, “the affair shall be so well conducted
that the defeat shall be with the heretics.”</p>

<p>For this end Henry IV. chose as judges of the controversy
four very decided (Roman) Catholics, and only two Calvinists,
who were moreover suspected. Dufrêne Canaye, who had
already pledged his troth to the king to embrace (Roman)
Catholicism, and De Casaubon, who, caring only for Greek and
Latin manuscripts, affected great indifference for matters of
faith. It is related of him that he replied to his son, who
asked for his blessing, after having entered the order of the
Capuchins: “I give you my blessing with all my heart: I
do not blame you; do not blame me either.”</p>

<p>Mornay perceived the snare, and remonstrated against
such a want of impartiality. “Sire,” said he to the king,
“if there were nothing more concerned than my life, or even
my honour, I would cast them at your feet. But since I am
obliged to defend the truth, where the honour of God is concerned,
I beseech your majesty to pardon me, if I seek just
and reasonable means to secure it.”</p>

<p>Far from acceding fairly to this request, the king answered
roughly that he had greatly offended him by attacking the
pope, to “<em>whom he was under more obligations than to his own
father</em>.” “Well! sire,” said Mornay, “since it so pleases God,
I see the thing is settled: you will be made to condemn the
truth between four walls, and God will give me grace, if I
live, to make it echo to the four corners of the world.”</p>

<p>The day was fixed for the conference. Henry had imported
into this quarrel so violent a passion that he could not sleep
the night preceding. M. de Loménie, who slept in his room,
said to him, as an historian writes: “‘Your majesty must
take this affair strangely to heart: on the eve of Coutras,
Arques, and Ivry, three battles where all was at stake, your
majesty was not so troubled.’ All this the king confessed; so
eagerly did he desire to content the pope by the ruin of
M. Duplessis!”</p>

<p>But the unfair choice of commissioners was not enough.
The incriminated texts were not indicated to Mornay until
the very day of the conference at one o’clock, and he lost another
hour before he could obtain the books that were required<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
to verify his quotations. At eight o’clock, he was summoned
to the king’s presence, although the discussion was not to
open till noon; the object was, to use the expression of an
historian, “<em>to make him lose his time</em>.” At this last trait,
Mornay’s whole soul was moved with indignation, “Sire,”
he exclaimed, “may your majesty pardon me! This extraordinary
rigour towards a good servant is unnatural in you.”</p>

<p>When the time had arrived, the lords and ladies of the
court, members of the council, magistrates of the Parliament,
bishops and priests, were assembled in the great hall of the
palace of Fontainebleau. Duperron advanced, with smiling
countenance, and proud of a victory he knew to be already
won beforehand. Mornay came also, not thinking it possible
to retreat without compromising the cause of the Gospel; but
he had been able only to verify a very few of his quotations;
he was suffering, dejected, and but too certain of the sentence
that would be pronounced.</p>

<p>At the opening of the conference, the plan of attack
was changed: instead of “enormous falsehoods,” it became
merely a question of “<em>simple mistakes</em>!” Now, what was
there surprising that in a great book wholly filled with
quotations, the author should have fallen into some inaccuracies?
Mornay did not defend himself well, and upon some
thousands of texts, the judges condemned nine. The following
night he fell ill, which served as a pretext for breaking
up the conference.</p>

<p>Henry wished to sup in the hall of this theological tournament,
as he would have done on a field of battle. He
announced all over the kingdom the success he had obtained,
and he wrote to the Duke d’Epernon: “I have done a marvel.”
Duperron was triumphant. “Let us confess the
truth,” said the king to him, who could not long repress his
humour for raillery, “the good right stood much in need of
good aid.”</p>

<p>Clement VIII. manifested great joy at this victory. He
annulled the marriage of Henry IV., and sent the cardinal’s
hat to Duperron.</p>

<p>It should be noted, in exculpation of Henry IV., that he
publicly praised Mornay shortly after the conference, and
declared that he had never had a better or a nobler servant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
The conscience of the man protested against the diplomacy
of the king.</p>

<p>Duplessis returned, broken-hearted, to his government of
Saumur. “Courage,” said his wife; “it is God who has
done this. Only keep your heart and your mind ready for
the work.” He set himself to verify all the texts on the
<em>Eucharist</em>, and published a new edition, which received the
approbation of the theologians of France and Geneva.
Neither the king, nor Cardinal Duperron, cared any more
about the matter; they had both obtained what they wished.</p>

<p>These were the most important events of the second half
of the reign of Henry IV.; and when we recollect the horrible
scenes that had preceded them, we are happy that we
have only to register theological strifes. If they still stirred
up burning passions, human blood no longer flowed.</p>

<p>Divine worship was celebrated almost everywhere without
obstacle in the seven hundred and sixty churches that remained
to the French Reformation; and when serious
grievances were laid before the council, they were redressed.
The faithful of Paris had been compelled to open their
church in the little village of Ablon, five leagues from the
town. The courtiers complained that they could not on the
same day discharge their duty to God and the king. The
poor also complained of the distance. Some of the children
carried to the meetings, according to the discipline, for baptism,
had died on the way. The king was touched with
these difficulties, and in 1606 permitted the Reformers to
exercise their worship at Charenton; which lasted until the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a horrible catastrophe was preparing in the
dark. The Jesuits, expelled from the kingdom after the
crime of Jean Châtel, had returned, because Henry IV.,
having to choose between two dangers, preferred having
them near him than against him. And when it was urged
upon him how wrong it was to recall these perfidious and
sanguinary monks; “Ventre-Saint-Gris,” said he, “will you
answer for my person.” He tried to gain them by confidence
and good services. Father Cotton was even named confessor
of the king, and preceptor of the dauphin. But nothing
disarmed them, any more than it did the dregs of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
who, mindful of the sermons of the League, always esteemed
the Béarnese king as an excommunicated heretic.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, 1610, Ravaillac buried his knife in
the bosom of Henry IV. This wretch confessed in his interrogatories
that he had given way to the temptation to kill
him, because in warring against the pope, the king made
war against God, “<em>inasmuch as the pope is God</em>!” Thus a
sacrilegious doctrine had begotten the crime of regicide.</p>

<p>Henry IV. has occupied a great place in the memory and
love of the French. He redeemed his weaknesses by eminent
qualities, and his very faults by the splendid services which
he rendered to his people. It is from his reign, as has been
remarked, that the end of the Middle Ages really dates;
and the Reformers have ever been grateful to a prince, who
was the first that sincerely granted them the free exercise of
their religion.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_II">II.</h3>
</div>


<p>The news of the king’s death re-awakened all the fears of
the Calvinists. Many families hastily quitted Paris, although
the guardianship of the gates had been confided to burghers
of both religions, as if they had been threatened with another
Saint Bartholomew. The Duke de Sully shut himself up in
the Bastille, of which he was the governor. The Huguenots
of the southern provinces took arms. It seemed as if the
Edict of Nantes had been torn by the same blow that had
pierced the heart of Henry.</p>

<p>From the 22nd of May, the court published a declaration,
confirming in the most explicit terms all the edicts of toleration,
a useless precaution; for the Reformers believed
neither in the power of the regent Marie de Medicis, nor in
her good faith. They feared they should find in her, and in
her son Louis XIII., then but eight years and a half old, a
second Queen Catherine, and a new Charles IX.</p>

<p>Marie de Medicis was governed by two Italian adventurers,
Concini and Leonora Galigaï. An ignorant, bigoted,
and vindictive woman, with all the vices of ambition unmixed
with its qualities, she ruled the great affairs of the
state upon the predictions of astrologers, and thought, by
throwing herself into the petty intrigues of the court, that
she was using the means of government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>The public treasury, under her regency, was given up to
the pillage of the great lords, and the kingdom to their turbulent
factions. The dukes de Nevers, de Mayenne, d’Epernon,
de Longueville, de Vendôme, cantoned themselves each
in his province, dictating their conditions of obedience to
the crown, and offering to the chiefs of the Calvinists the
dangerous example of subordinating the general interest to
their personal pretensions.</p>

<p>Some of these were too much inclined to follow such an
example, particularly the Duke de Bouillon and the Marshal
de Lesdiguières, the former, a man of capacity and good
counsel, but committing fault upon fault, through his ambition
to be the first person in the kingdom; the latter, skilful
and brave upon the field of battle, but loose in morals, unscrupulous
as to the means of success, and seduced by the
prospect of the constable’s sword. Both pretended to feel a
great zeal for religion, in order to win the support of the
Huguenots; nevertheless they were soon suspected by their
old friends, and did not render to the court the services they
had let it to expect.</p>

<p>The Duke de Sully, despoiled of all his offices, imported
into the affairs of the Reformation the bad humour of a
disgraced minister. He did not always retreat before extreme
opinions, but at the moment of passing to the execution
of them, his solid sense restrained him, and he never
forgot that he had been one of the most faithful servants of
the crown.</p>

<p>His son-in-law, the Duke Henry de Rohan, then thirty-two
years of age, had begun to show himself, and was preparing
to take the highest place in the Calvinist party.
Young, active, of almost royal birth, as much attached to
study as to the trade of arms, he had already travelled
through all the different states of Europe to acquaint himself
with their powers and their genius. He was simple and
austere in his manners, intrepid, generous, naturally inclined
to great achievements, and capable of accomplishing them.
His oratory was clear, terse, and vigorous—the true eloquence
of a party leader. His religious sentiments inspired more
confidence than those of other noblemen of his rank; and
history testifies that in all his enterprises, devotion to the
Reformed cause prevailed over ambition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>Duplessis-Mornay, either because years had cooled his
ardour, or because he had better calculated the small military
resources of the Huguenots, inclined to pacific measures, and
advised that everything should be borne rather than that
they should fly to arms. As soon as he heard of the death
of the king, he convoked the magistrates of Saumur, and
said to them, “Let us talk no more of Huguenots and Papists;
these words are forbidden by the edicts. But were there
no edict in existence, if we are Frenchmen, if we love our
country, our families, ourselves, they should be henceforth
effaced from our minds. There should be only one badge for
all. Whoever is a good Frenchman, him will I love as a
good citizen, and as a good brother.”</p>

<p>As the court felt at that time the necessity of conciliating
the Reformers, it offered to Mornay either money or favours.
This disinterested servant of Henry IV. replied to these proposals
that it should never be said that he profited by the
general misfortune, importuned the mourning of the queen,
or afflicted the minority of the king. “I leave to the queen,”
he said, “to judge if I deserve anything, should she please
to give me what has been long my due. But in this calamity
I ask for nothing, and am as grateful as if the queen had
bestowed [everything upon me.”]</p>

<p>He applied himself, without relaxation, under the regency
of Marie de Medicis, to defeat intrigue, and to appease
resentment. The president Jeannin wrote to him after the
troubles excited by the Prince de Condé, “You have so conducted
yourself during this wretched war, that their majesties
are well pleased, and therein acknowledge your prudence and
fidelity.” Duplessis-Mornay had reason to know before he
died, how oblivious and ungrateful are kings!</p>

<p>All the opposite passions of the Calvinist party appeared
together in the political assembly, convoked at first at
Châtellerault, and opened at Saumur on the 27th of May,
1611. The court authorized its meeting with repugnance
and disquietude, and imposed upon it the condition that it
should dissolve as soon as it had prepared the list of the six
persons, out of whom the king had to choose two general
deputies; but it was very evident that the delegates of the
Reformation did not come from all points of the kingdom for
the sole purpose of inscribing six names upon a bulletin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>The assembly of Saumur again numbered seventy members,—thirty
gentlemen, twenty pastors, sixteen deputies of the
<i lang="fr">Tiers-état</i>, and four delegates of the government of La
Rochelle, which formed at that time a separate principality.
Fifteen provinces were represented, without counting Béarn,
whose deputies were admitted after some little hesitation.
The principal noblemen of the party had likewise been summoned
by special letters. Among them appeared the Marshal
de Lesdiguières, the dukes de Bouillon, de Sully, and
de Rohan, and Duplessis-Mornay, who, without being of the
same rank, compensated for the inferiority of his titles, by
his long services and the authority of his character.</p>

<p>The Duke de Bouillon aspired to the presidency, by relying
upon the intrigues of the court. He was not elected. Three-fourths
of the votes were given for Duplessis-Mornay, and
the pastor Chamier was named as vice-president. By this
decision the king’s council were plainly told that political
passions would not predominate in the assembly, and that
its chief object would be the interests of religion, but that
upon this article it was resolute not to make any compromise.</p>

<p>The session lasted nearly four months, in the midst of
laborious negotiations, the court requiring the prompt dissolution
of the assembly, and the latter resolving not to separate
until it obtained a redress of its list of grievances. The
oath of union was renewed, which consisted in swearing
obedience and fidelity to the king, “<em>the sovereign empire of
God remaining always in its entirety</em>.” This reservation, so
legitimate and so unimpeachable in itself, nevertheless opened
the door to farther contests. At length the assembly
separated, after having chosen and seen two general deputies
accepted.</p>

<p>Henry de Rohan displayed his talents as a statesman and
great political orator in this assembly. He recommended
union, order, the duty of investigating the grievances of the
most humble Reformer, of resolutely challenging admission to
all offices in the kingdom, and of providing for the safe-keeping
of the towns of hostage. “We have come,” said he, “to
a cross-way where many roads meet, but there is only one
which has any safety for us. The life of Henry the Great
maintained it; in this crisis our virtue must do so....
Let our aim be the glory of God and the security of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
churches, which He has so miraculously established in this
kingdom, striving with ardour for the good of one another,
but by legitimate means. Let us be scrupulous in demanding
only those things that are necessary; let us be firm in obtaining
them.”</p>

<p>Other political assemblies were convened in succeeding
years, at Grenoble, Nismes, La Rochelle, Loudun. The
old historians distinguish the members who composed them,
by the following qualifications: <em>the ambitious</em>, who used the
pretext of religion to gain their particular ends; the <em>zealous</em>,
or well-disposed, who only sought to practise their offices of
piety in peace; the <em>judicious</em>, who tried to unite the interests
of faith with those of policy; and lastly, the <em>timid</em>, who were
ready to submit to everything rather than risk their ease or
fortune. Those who dwelt in Paris and the provinces, where
the Reformation was weak, habitually counselled measures
of prudence, from the fear of being crushed; others, relying
upon their power, spoke haughtily, and displayed the half-drawn
sword. The distinction between the Reformers of
the north and those of the south, already sensibly perceived,
was shown more strongly in what followed.</p>

<p>The convocations of the national synods were equally frequent,
and their ecclesiastical bodies interfered more than
they had hitherto done in political questions, among others,
in the synod of Privas, of which the session opened on the
23rd May, 1612. The pastor Chamier was its president or
moderator, and the pastor Pierre Dumoulin was named as
his deputy. The members of the synod complained of the
letters patent of abolition or of pardon, published by the
king’s council in the preceding month of April.</p>

<p>“The churches of this kingdom,” said they, “declare that
they have never required, asked, or endeavoured to obtain grace
or pardon, and that none of their body are guilty of those
imaginary crimes imputed to them; that they are all ready,
individually and collectively, to answer for their actions, to
publish them to the whole world, and to show them in open
day, in the sight of every species of torture, more easy to
bear than so shameful a blot of infamy, which would make
them despicable and hateful to posterity, and rob them of
the honour that has been ever attributed to them, of being
good Frenchmen.... Moreover, they declared that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
would not avail themselves, nor in any way use the said
letters of amnesty and pardon; and that if there should be
any persons who had accepted them, or consented to accept
them, that they disavowed them.”</p>

<p>The same synod undertook the re-establishment of harmony
among the Calvinist noblemen who had disagreed at
Saumur; and there resulted a solemn act of reconciliation,
which was signed on the 16th of August, by the marshals de
Bouillon and de Lesdiguières, the dukes de Sully, de Rohan,
de Soubise, the marquis de la Force, and Duplessis-Mornay.</p>

<p>Another matter, more directly religious, was agitated on
different occasions in the provincial and national synods.
The subject was the conduct of Jérémie Ferrier—who has
been already named—in the beginning a vehement defender
of the Reformed communion, but afterwards secretly won
over and paid by the court. Ferrier possessed considerable
learning, combined with a fertile mind and ready speech;
but his orthodoxy and probity were suspected. He was
accused of having enunciated antichristian propositions concerning
the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, and of having
improperly administered the funds of the Academy of
Nismes. He was severely reprimanded on this account,
and thereupon threw himself into the arms of the (Roman)
Catholics.</p>

<p>Ferrier was recompensed for his apostasy by the title of
councillor of the court of judicature at Nismes, in 1613.
The consistory excommunicated him, and the people, who
thenceforward styled him “<em>the traitor Judas</em>,” desired to
oppose his installation. His houses in town and country
were gutted, and he himself was forced to retire for a while
to Beaucaire.</p>

<p>The synod of Bas-Languedoc, upon the authority of the
national synod of Privas, confirmed Ferrier’s excommunication
in the most solemn terms: “We, pastors and elders,
declare that the said M. Jérémie Ferrier is a scandalous,
incorrigible, impenitent, and unruly man; and as such,
after having invoked the name of the living and true God,
and in the name and by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by the direction of the Holy Ghost, and the authority of the
Church, we have cast, and do cast him forth from the society
of the faithful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Ferrier obtained, through the favour of the Jesuits, the
post of councillor of state, and became the apologist of Cardinal
de Richelieu. He died in 1626, detested by the Calvinists
and little esteemed by the (Roman) Catholics. His
daughter, who married the criminal-lieutenant Pardieu,
figures in the satires of Boileau, for her sordid avarice: she
was murdered by robbers in 1664.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_III">III.</h3>
</div>


<p>The situation of the Reformers grew worse, in spite of the
reiterated declarations of the council respecting the faithful
execution of the edicts. Their rights were continually disregarded
in the courts of justice, in the nominations to
public offices, hospitals, the dole of alms, places of worship,
everywhere and wherever it was possible to vex and harass
them without too openly violating the laws.</p>

<p>In the States-General, assembled in 1614, the orator of
the <i lang="fr">Tiers-parti</i> spoke in favour of toleration. But the clergy
and even the nobility gave the meeting to understand that,
sooner or later, the king would fulfil the oath of his coronation,
by which he had promised to expel all heretics denounced
by the Church from the countries of his jurisdiction.
Cardinal Duperron declared that the edicts were only provisional
or suspensive, and that all that had been granted
was a simple reprieve to rebellious subjects.</p>

<p>It would be difficult in our time to conceive to what extent
the demands of the clergy against heretics proceeded, on
being preferred to the king, after they had deliberated upon
them in their general assemblies. They embraced a prohibition
to write against the sacraments of the Romish church
and the authority of the pope; prohibition to keep schools
in the cities, and even in the suburbs of episcopal towns;
prohibition for the ministers to enter hospitals to console the
sick of their communion; prohibition for foreigners to teach
anything but (Roman) Catholicism; prohibition for the
judges of chambers, equally divided by an equality of votes,
to adopt the less rigorous sentence; lastly, a speedy interdiction
of all exercise of the pretended Reformed religion.
These demands were periodically renewed, with clauses increasingly
harsh and oppressive, until the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, and afterwards down to 1787. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
until the great voice of the nation raised itself in the
Constituent Assembly, that that of the priests was finally
silenced.</p>

<p>The project of a double marriage—between the young
king with an infanta of Spain, and of the prince of the
Asturias with a daughter of France—a project supported
by the Holy See—redoubled the fears of the Huguenots. It
was generally rumoured that one of the conditions of the
alliance between the two courts, was the destruction of
heresy, and the (Roman) Catholic preachers took this as the
text of their sermons. “If the Jesuits,” wrote Duplessis-Mornay
to the chancellor De Sillery, “preach without circumlocution,
that the design of this double marriage with
Spain is to be the extirpation of heresy, can any one be
surprised that our churches should take alarm, and that the
minutes of the assemblies should speak of it?”</p>

<p>The Prince de Condé, a bigoted (Roman) Catholic, as we
have seen, tried to turn the disquietude of the Calvinist
party to the advantage of his personal cause, by invoking
the memory of his father and grandfather. He published a
manifesto in 1615, in which he told the Reformers that the
Edict of Nantes would be abolished, and that the king’s only
object in collecting his troops was their extermination.
These provocations carried away some gentlemen of the
political assemblies of Grenoble and Nismes. The Duke de
Rohan took the field on the side of Saintonge; but the
body of the Calvinists, including Lesdiguières, Châtillon,
Sully, and Mornay, did not rise. The last wrote on this
occasion, that “a negotiation would be renewed, by means of
which the prince would be contented; while their churches
would remain behind, loaded with all the odium, and perhaps
also with the war itself.” This is exactly what happened.
Condé made his peace with the court, without any regard for
the position or the interests of his allies.</p>

<p>A more serious event—the oppression of the Reformation
in Béarn—occurred to furnish more weighty motives for the
recommencement of the wars of religion.</p>

<p>The principality of Basse-Navarre and Béarn, annexed
to France by Henry IV., was more closely re-united in 1617.
Three-fourths of the population, some say nine-tenths, belonged
to the Reformed communion. They were nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
ordered to reinstate the priests in all the ecclesiastical
property which had been applied, since the year 1569, to
the use of the churches, schools, hospitals, and poor.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Arnoux said that this property “<em>belonged to
God, who was its owner</em>,” and that consequently no one had
the power or the right to take it.</p>

<p>The States of Béarn, the nobility, the magistrates of the
towns, the people, all protested energetically, but in vain.
The king took the field at the head of an army, and the
Béarnese not being able to oppose more than a short resistance,
he entered the town of Pau on the 15th October,
1620. He remained there no longer than two days, “for
there was no church there,” says an historian of the time,
“where he might thank God, from whom he held this inheritance,
and he therefore went to have the mass chanted
before his soldiers, at Navarreins, where it had not been
solemnized for fifty years previously. Bishops, abbots, and
curates re-entered into possession of the property of the
church, the Jesuits taking a goodly share.”</p>

<p>The course of the royal troops was marked with cruel
violence. “Nothing was heard to escape from the mouth
of the most moderate,” says Elie Benoît, “but threats of exemplary
punishment; of hanging, decapitating, and abolishing
the Reformed religion throughout the whole kingdom, which
they called <em>accursed</em>; of banishing all who professed it, or
of compelling them to wear some badge of infamy.” The
soldiers shattered the doors of the churches, demolished the
walls, tore the books and the tables where the commandments
of God were written. They robbed and maltreated
the peasants with their staves and their swords, who came
to the market of Pau, adjudging them beforehand to be all
Huguenots. They forced the Reformers, who fell into their
hands, to make the sign of the cross, and to kneel when the
procession [of the host] passed by. The women dared not
venture into the streets.... Some, who were with child, they
compelled to swear to baptize their infants at the Romish
church. “Children were carried off, the parents knew not
whither, or how to recover them; and all this was done under
the eyes of the king, who refused even to listen to the complaints
of the injured. In the other parts of the country, the
soldiers lived as they pleased; publicly told that the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
had given the Huguenots up to them for pillage, they expelled
the ministers, outraged their wives, and drove men
and women to mass with blows and with curses.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Such was the first essay of the <ins class="corr" id="tn-239" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'dragonades'">
<i lang="fr">dragonnades</i></ins>, which system
was before long to be perfected and extended under the
reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The indignation of the churches on the news of the persecutions
in Béarn may be imagined. It was not this time
the great lords of the party who cried for warlike measures.
They saw too well that the Calvinists, doubly weakened by
their internal dissensions and their defections, would not be
able to make head against the king.</p>

<p>Some pastors also advised the Reformers to remain quiet.
Pierre Dumoulin, who exercised great authority among the
Consistorialists, wrote, after the national synod of Alais,
of which he had been the moderator, that all ought to endure
with patience the renewed strokes of the enemy. “If
we must be persecuted,” said he, “all those who fear God
desire that it should be for the profession of the Gospel, and
that our persecution should truly be the cross of Christ.”</p>

<p>But the people of the Huguenots, seconded by the lesser
nobility, and by the burghers of La Rochelle, would not
hearken to this pacific counsel. Had not the king forsworn
in Béarn the oaths he had taken at the assembly of Loudun?
Was not the cause of the Béarnese the cause of all? Would
not they be obliged to suffer likewise on the first occasion?
Did not the advisers of Louis XIII. incite him to make an
end of the Huguenots without delay? Was not their extermination
preached from all the (Roman) Catholic pulpits?
And was it not better to take counsel of their despair, than
to wait in fatal security for their death-blow?</p>

<p>These sentiments were dominant in the political assembly
convoked at La Rochelle in the month of December, 1620.
The king had sent an usher to prohibit the deputies of the
churches from meeting, and the inhabitants of La Rochelle
from receiving them. When the usher had performed his
mission, the magistrates of the town replied to him: “Since
you have executed your orders, you will quit this place as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>The noblemen of the party still essayed to act as mediators
between the court and the assembly. The dukes de
Rohan, de Soubise, and de la Trémouille, had an interview at
Niort with some of the deputies. Duplessis-Mornay exerted
in these negotiations all the power and influence he possessed.
But the difficulties appeared insurmountable. The king’s
council ordered the assembly to dissolve immediately, and
the assembly would not separate until they had obtained the
redress of their grievances, and solid guarantees for the free
exercise of their religion. On one side it was said: “Return
home, and you shall have satisfaction.” On the other it was
replied: “Give us satisfaction, and we will return home.”
Mornay, in speaking of the assembly of Loudun, had well
stated this twofold position: “The king orders them to
dissolve, and promises to act; we beseech him to act, being
ready to dissolve.”</p>

<p>The debate had no result, because on either side there
were after-thoughts. The council wished at least to destroy
the political organization of the Reformers, and the latter
maintained it with obstinate constancy, under the full persuasion,
not without reason, that on such political organization
their religious liberty depended.</p>

<p>The assembly of La Rochelle, tired of transmitting to the
court justifications and useless petitions, passed, at length, on
the 10th of May, 1621, by a majority of six or seven votes,
a resolution, bold even to rashness, and which breathed the
republican spirit of the people of La Rochelle. The measure
went far beyond the rights granted by the Edict of
Nantes, and however bad were the designs of the council, it
cannot be approved of.</p>

<p>France, with regard to the Reformers, was divided into
eight departments or <em>circles</em>, an expression borrowed from
the political establishment of Germany; and each circle was
to be placed under the government of one of the leaders of
the party. The supreme authority was confided to the Duke
de Bouillon. The governors might levy money, appoint to
offices, organize armies, and give battle. Three deputies of
the assembly were to assist in the councils held by the general-in-chief
and the military commanders. Lastly, the assembly
reserved to themselves the power of concluding treaties of
peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>This organization, however, had more of appearance than
reality. The Duke de Bouillon remained neutral. The
Marshal de Lesdiguières was on the point of embracing
(Roman) Catholicism. The Duke de la Trémouille, and the
Marquis de Châtillon, grandson of Coligny, were wavering,
and soon about to exchange the command of the Huguenots
for the bâtons of marshals. The Marquis de la Force dreaded
an open rupture with the court. The Duke de Sully was
anxious for quiet. Mornay refused to take part in this
recourse to arms. There were among all the leaders but the
Duke de Rohan, and his brother, the Duke de Soubise, who
showed themselves disposed to throw their whole fortunes
into the new wars of religion.</p>

<p>Nor did the provinces that had been divided into circles,
reply with a unanimous voice to the appeal of the assembly
Picardy, Normandy, the Orleanais, the Isle of France, where
the number of Reformers was small, even Poitou and Dauphiny,
where they were more numerous, refused to take up
arms. All the efforts of resistance were concentrated in
Saintonge, Guienne, Quercy, and the two provinces of Languedoc.</p>

<p>The regulations adopted by the assembly of La Rochelle,
for the maintenance of religion and good order in the army,
are deserving of mention, as an interesting trait of manners.
Pastors were to say prayers and preach daily to the soldiery.
The troops were forbidden to swear, under pain of a fine
proportioned to the rank of the delinquent; a <em>teston</em> for a
private, a <em>crown</em> for an officer. Heavier penalties awaited any
who brought women into the military encampments. The
protection of agriculture and commerce was enjoined. Prisoners
were placed under the safeguard of the council. These
regulations proved that the assembly of La Rochelle were
anxious to honour this new war; but their execution required
a fervent piety, that had already become rare at
that time.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_IV">IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>Louis XIII. had commenced hostilities, by advancing his
army towards the Loire on the 24th of April, fifteen days
before the adoption of the resolution at La Rochelle. Some,
the sagest members of his council, had persisted in proposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
means of accommodation. They represented that the Huguenots
held two hundred fortified places, that their soldiers
were of approved bravery, that despair made them still
more redoubtable, that there were in the churches four hundred
thousand men capable of bearing arms, and that the
Calvinists had for sixty years lost more by peace than by
war. Others counselled, on the contrary, that a great and
decisive blow should be struck against the Calvinist party,
and Louis XIII. adopted the last opinion.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, his early masters and spiritual directors,
urged him unceasingly to undertake the destruction of the
churches, and invented arguments to make him safely violate
the word he had given to the heretics. “The promises of
the king,” said his confessor Arnoux, “are either promises
of conscience or of state. Those made to the Huguenots
are not of conscience, for they are against the precepts of the
Church, and if they are of state, they should be referred to
the privy council, whose advice is, not to keep them.” Thus
reasoned the contemporary and brother of Escobar.</p>

<p>The pope offered two hundred thousand crowns, on condition
that the Huguenots were brought back willingly, or
by force, into the Church of Rome. He also addressed a
brief to Louis XIII., wherein he praised him for having
imitated his ancestors, who had “<em>honoured the exhortations of
the pope as much as the commandments of God</em>.” The cardinals
offered, on the same condition, two hundred thousand
crowns, and the priests a million.</p>

<p>In the harangues pronounced by the orator of the clergy,
the king was pressed to follow the example of Philip Augustus,
the grandfather of Saint Louis, who had utterly exterminated
the Albigenses, or at least the example of the Emperor
Constantius, who had forced the idolaters to quit the
towns and to dwell in the villages, whence they had derived,
said this priest, the name of Pagans.</p>

<p>The emissaries of Spain, with which country the double
marriage had led to a strict alliance, were urgent for war,
from reasons of a different kind. Every time France was
troubled, the court of Madrid felt stronger, and its language
assumed a higher tone.</p>

<p>The king therefore put himself at the head of his army,
with the Constable de Luynes, the Duke de Lesdiguières, who
had openly declared for the court, the Cardinal de Guise, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
crowd of lords, and his mother, Marie de Medicis, whom he
distrusted. His council had taken the precaution to distinguish,
before the commencement of the campaign, between
the <em>peaceable</em> Calvinists and those who were not so—a distinction
which gave the timid and the venal the opportunity
of keeping at home, without being accused of treason.</p>

<p>One of the first exploits of Louis XIII. was the capture
of the town and castle of Saumur, by deceit and treachery.
Duplessis-Mornay had been governor of the place from the
reign of Henry III. He kept it as a town of hostage,
granted by the edicts; and as it commanded the course of
the Loire, it was of great importance to the Calvinist party.
The Constable de Luynes demanded ingress in the name of
the king, promising that the immunities of Saumur should
be as safe as the eye of the governor, and to this “<em>he pledged
his word, as well as that of his majesty, with his own mouth,
which was also confirmed by M. de Lesdiguières</em>.” Mornay
opened the gates of the fortress, and led out, according to
custom, the Calvinist garrison. But as soon as the king had
entered with his troops, he declared that he took definite
possession of Saumur.</p>

<p>To give to this breach of faith the appearance of an amicable
arrangement, Mornay was offered, beside payment of
the arrears of his appointment, one hundred thousand crowns
and a marshal’s bâton. He retorted with indignation, that
if he had loved money, he might have gained millions under
the preceding reigns, and that, as for dignities, he had always
been more desirous of rendering himself worthy of them,
than of obtaining them. “I cannot, either in conscience or
honour,” he added, “traffic in the liberty or safety of others.”</p>

<p>He went to dwell in his house, where he died on the 11th
of November, 1623. His last hours were full of serenity.
“We saw clearly the Gospel of the Son of God engraved on
his heart by the Holy Ghost,” said the almoner of his family,
Jean Daillé; “we saw him in the midst of death firmly
possessed of life, and enjoying a full contentment at a moment
when all men are usually shaken with fear. And this
lesson was so striking and efficacious, that even those who
suffered most from his loss, reaped both joy and edification.”
He made his confession of faith, avowing that he had received
much, and had little profited. And when he was told that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
had faithfully employed his talent: “Ah! what is there of
mine?” he exclaimed. “Do not say I, but God through
me.”</p>

<p>Philippe de Mornay was the last representative of that
great and strong generation, which had received the lessons
of Calvin, and the examples of Coligny. He had shown
that it is possible to preserve, during half a century, even in
those worst of all wars, the wars of religion, a spotless name,
an irreproachable character, conduct always even, and a humane
and generous nature. This is the highest glory to
which man can attain.</p>

<p>Beyond Saumur, the royal army encountered no serious
resistance until it arrived before the gates of Saint Jean
d’Angély, commanded by the Duke de Soubise. The siege
began on the 30th of May, 1621, and lasted twenty-six
days. Among the number of volunteers was the Cardinal
de Guise, who acquitted himself in the soldier’s calling better
than he had done in that of the priest. He embarked in it
with so much ardour that he died of fatigue, a few days
after, in the town of Saintes.</p>

<p>The king thence betook himself to Basse-Guienne, all
the towns hastening to throw open their gates to him,
except the little place of Clairac, which styled itself “<em>a town
without a king, defended by soldiers without fear</em>.” It was
taken after twelve days’ siege. A pastor named La Fargue,
together with his father and son-in-law, was condemned to
death.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August, the royal army commenced an
attack upon Montauban. This siege is celebrated in the
annals of the French Reformation. The town of Montauban
enjoyed municipal franchises, which had inspired its
inhabitants with a great spirit of independence. Its councillors
were men of head and action, and the firmness of
their faith redoubled their energy. The Marquis de la
Force had the command. The Duke de Rohan held his
head-quarters at a little distance, and supplied it with succours
of men and ammunition.</p>

<p>Louis XIII. presented himself before the walls of Montauban
with the Constable, the dukes de Mayenne, d’Angoulême,
de Montmorency, the Count de Bassompierre, and the
<i lang="fr">élite</i> of the nobility of the kingdom. He also, during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
siege, enlisted an auxiliary of a very different kind. This was
a Spanish Carmelite, the Father Domenique de Jesu-Maria,
who had performed, it was said, miracle upon miracle, in the
preceding year, during the war of the emperor of Germany
against Bohemia. He passed for a great prophet: the
soldiers called him the <em>Blessed Father</em>. As he was returning
to his monastery in Spain, he visited the camp of the king,
who asked him for his advice. The monk directed that four
hundred discharges of artillery should be played against the
town, after which it would infallibly surrender. The four
hundred shots were fired, but the town did not yield.</p>

<p>The siege lasted two months and a half, and the royal
army tried, at repeated intervals, to take it by assault, but
without success. At length, after considerable loss, the king,
on the setting in of the adverse season, was, with tears in
his eyes, compelled to retire. He raised the siege on the
2nd of November. “The people of Montauban,” says an
historian, “were advertised of the approaching withdrawal
of the army by a soldier of the religion, who the evening
before the raising of the siege, betook himself to playing on
the flute the sixty-eighth Psalm. The beleaguered inhabitants
took this for the sign of their deliverance, and they
were not deceived.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The war recommenced in 1622, and was conducted with
unheard-of rigour. The prisoners were treated as rebels;
some were executed on the spot, others were sent to the
galleys. The Marquis de la Force, daunted by the dangers
that menaced his person and his house, concluded a private
treaty with the court, by which he delivered up Sainte
Foy and Basse-Guienne. Many of the Calvinist leaders
were either intimidated, or gained like him, so that the Huguenots
were more injured by defections than by defeats.</p>

<p>The little town of Nègrepelisse, close by Montauban, was
the object of horrible reprisals. All the inhabitants were
put to the sword: they were accused of having massacred
the (Roman) Catholic garrison in the preceding winter.
“Mothers, who had saved themselves with their children, by
crossing the river, could obtain no pity from the soldiers on
the banks, but were thrust back or killed. In half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
every one in the town was slaughtered, and the streets were
so cumbered with the dead and blood that they were scarcely
passable. Those who escaped into the castle were constrained
to surrender on the next day at discretion, and
were all hanged.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Another large village of the same parts, Saint Antonin,
tried to defend itself; even the women armed themselves
with scythes and halberts. But the place could not long
withstand the royal army. The garrison, holding a white
wand, were allowed to quit the town. Ten burghers were
hanged with the pastor, formerly a monk of the order of the
Cordeliers. The inhabitants redeemed themselves from pillage
(the historians of the time perhaps exaggerate the
amount) by a contribution of fifty thousand crowns.</p>

<p>To sanctify this war, at once so full of cruelty and treason,
the lords and captains of the king’s army performed great
acts of devotion at Toulouse. The Prince de Condé, the
Duke de Vendôme, the Duke de Chevreux, went to confession
and communicated with six hundred gentlemen of their
friends. Some of them affiliated themselves with the order of
the Blue Penitents; “which,” says a chronicle, “had this
advantage, that imposing no obligation, it offered great indulgences,
even at the moment of death.”</p>

<p>The army arrived on the 30th of August, 1622, before the
walls of Montpellier, which had a strong garrison of Huguenots.
The siege made no progress; and Louis XIII., fearing
a similar check to that which he had experienced before the
ramparts of Montauban, consented to treat with the Duke de
Rohan for a general peace. The articles were agreed upon
about the middle of October.</p>

<p>The king confirmed the Edict of Nantes, ordered the
re-establishment of the two religions in the localities where
they had been before exercised, authorized the meetings of the
consistories, conferences, and synods for affairs purely ecclesiastical,
but forbade the holding of any political assembly
without his express permission. The fortifications of Montpellier
were to be demolished, and the town governed by four
consuls, to be named by the king. The Calvinists retained
two places of safety, Montauban and La Rochelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>This last town had been attacked several times during the
war, and had vigorously defended itself. It prolonged the
struggle some time after the new edict of peace, but ended
by accepting it with the stipulation that its liberties should
be maintained. Thus, after torrents of blood had been shed
and several provinces of the kingdom had been desolated,
everything remained nearly the same as when the war first
began.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_V">V.</h3>
</div>


<p>The treaty of 1622 was, like many of its predecessors,
nothing else than a dead letter; and to explain fully the new
recourse to arms, which terminated by the Edict of Grace in
1629, we must state at some length the false position into
which the maxims of intolerance, put in force from the death
of Henry IV., had placed both sides.</p>

<p>The Calvinists, continually disturbed in the exercise of
their religion, forced to carry arms to the very doors of their
churches, and threatened with the loss of all the rights they
had obtained by the Edict of Nantes, had become embittered
against royalty. They suspected it of concealed thoughts
and perfidious projects. They accused it of encouraging, at
least by its inertness, the Jesuits, the monks, the bishops,
the violent magistrates, and the populace, who not only heaped
upon them numberless vexations, but loudly announced the
approaching extirpation of heresy.</p>

<p>It necessarily resulted from this, that from being a simple
religious communion, the French Reformation became every
day more and more a political party, and thus from the very
nature of things, as the struggle was prolonged, the ideas
and passions of the Reformers were led into increased hostility
against the crown. The spirit of independence had
grown among the Huguenots with the persecutions, with
which they were stricken, and with the menaces of destruction
that were held over their heads, and many fostered the
thought of a republican establishment.</p>

<p>They therefore constituted a considerable party in the
first years of the reign of Louis XIII., relying for support,
within the kingdom, upon the malcontents of all kinds;—without,
upon Protestant Europe. They communicated
by La Rochelle with England, by Sédan with Germany, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Geneva with the Swiss cantons, and seemed ever ready to
divide the strength of the state.</p>

<p>Such an organization was intolerable to the crown, and
was so much the more the object of its dislike, as the principle
of national unity gradually succeeded in freeing itself
from the ruins of the old feudality. The lower the great
families were reduced before the royal authority, the more
would the political establishment of the Huguenots be
regarded as a singular and dangerous anomaly; and the
council was right in desiring enfranchisement from it at any
price.</p>

<p>But through the unhappy confusion, which universally
existed, at this epoch, in temporal and spiritual matters,
royalty, while announcing that it fought only against the
political privileges of the Calvinists, put many, very many
more in peril, and compromised all their religious rights.
People knew that there were impassioned spirits behind the
statesmen, and even amongst themselves, who, after having
reduced the Calvinists to become a simple sect, would constrain
them to re-enter the (Roman) Catholic church, or to quit the
kingdom.</p>

<p>It is true that the genius of the Cardinal de Richelieu, his
diplomatic alliances, and the European interests of France,
during half the reign of Louis XIV., retarded the complete
realization of these fears. Nevertheless the plan for the
extirpation of heresy was prosecuted in detail, without cessation
and without pity, over the whole face of France, from
the moment the Calvinist party was reduced. The capture
of La Rochelle was the first act of this cruel and merciless
drama, of which the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was
the <ins class="corr" id="tn-248" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'dênoument'">
<i lang="fr">dénouement</i></ins>.</p>

<p>Such then was the situation of affairs in 1622.—the Calvinists
drew the sword in behalf of their political immunities
in the name of their religious rights, which were unceasingly
compromised and menaced; and the crown attacked these
immunities in the name of the royal sovereignty and of the
unity of the country, in order afterwards to arrive at the
destruction of religion itself.</p>

<p>As for the respective forces of the two parties, they had
become strengthened on one side and weakened on the other,
since the wars of the sixteenth century. In spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
enterprises of some powerful noblemen, the authority of the
prince was more generally recognised, respected, and obeyed.
The lesser nobility, the <i lang="fr">Tiers-état</i> or commons, the magistrates
and the army, had, under the reign of Henry IV.,
abandoned feudal traditions to obey royalty alone, and this
new spirit had naturally modified the sentiments of many
Reformers, who went, unwittingly perhaps, with the great
national stream. On the other side, the Calvinist leaders
and towns, who clung to their privileges, had no longer the
same faith, or the same enthusiasm. There were disunions,
mistrust, depression below, and defections above, in the French
Reformation. It could still make itself feared in the interior
or exterior complications of the kingdom; but it could not
form a coalition between province and province, or dictate
conditions of peace.</p>

<p>The dukes de Rohan and de Soubise, attacked in their
personal liberty after the treaty of 1622, took up arms in
Languedoc and Saintonge. The war was one of partisans
only; nothing more than sieges of villages or strong castles,
and devastations took place. The royal troops committed great
ravages round Montauban and Castres. “At night,” say
the memoirs of the time, “one might behold a thousand fires
along the plain. Crops, orchards, vines, and houses were the
aliments of the flames.... The destruction was so well
executed that there was not left a tree or a house standing,
a blade of corn, or the shoot of a vine.”</p>

<p>The majority of the Huguenots remained at their hearths,
and the Duke de Rohan complained of this with sorrow. “It
was more difficult,” he says, “to combat the cowardice, the
irreligion, and infidelity of the Reformers, than the hatred
of their enemies.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of the new troubles, a national synod
had been convoked at Charenton. It was opened on the 1st
of September, 1623. The place was convenient for the
court, as the proximity of Paris guaranteed to it the docility
of the assembly. An order was given to the synod to admit
a royal officer to its meetings. Although this commissioner,
named Galland, was of the Reformed religion, his mandate
caused him to be suspected. The deputies of the churches,
relying upon the letter of the treaties, and refusing to the
crown the right of establishing so important a novelty by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
simple ordinance, made many objections; but they were
forced to obey, and to content themselves with inscribing on
the minutes of their proceedings the following declaration:
“This synod, desirous of marking clearly and unmistakably
its dutifulness and fidelity to the king, admitted the said
Seigneur Galland among the deputies ... under the assurance
that his majesty would in his royal goodness re-establish us
in our ancient privileges and liberties.”</p>

<p>A second article, less explicable than the foregoing, was that
the king expressed his displeasure on the subject of the oath
that the national synod of Alais had caused to be taken,
three years before, to the doctrine of Dordrecht. The deputies
were again obliged to temporize; they answered, that
this doctrine was only conformable to that of their confession
of faith, and that the synod of Alais had no other design
than to establish the perfect union of the Reformers of
France with those of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>A third injunction concerned the foreign pastors, who had
been admitted to exercise their office in the kingdom. The
king wrote, that he would permit this no longer, and required
the immediate return of Primrose and Cameron, both
natives of Scotland, and ministers at Bordeaux; “not so
much because they are foreigners,” said Louis XIII., “but
particularly for reasons regarding our service.”</p>

<p>The principal of these reasons was that they had displeased
the Jesuits, especially Primrose. Wherefore he did not
obtain, as Cameron did, permission to reside in the kingdom,
on renouncing his pastoral charge.</p>

<p>One day Father Arnoux, the king’s confessor, preaching
before the court, solemnly affirmed that the casuists of his
society did not authorize regicide, and Louis XIII. thereupon
expressed great pleasure. Primrose, who was there,
asked the Jesuit if Jacques Clément had killed <em>his king</em>, or
even <em>a king</em>, by striking a prince <em>excommunicated by the pope</em>;
moreover, if, in case the Holy See should excommunicate the
reigning sovereign, whether the Jesuits would still recognise
Louis XIII. as <em>their king</em>; finally, if they were disposed to
condemn their disciples Jean Châtel and Ravaillac as guilty
of the crime of lese-majesty. These questions were embarrassing;
Arnoux’s answer was a sentence of banishment.</p>

<p>At the national synod of Castres, convoked in 1626, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
king’s officer Galland again took his seat, notwithstanding
the protestations of the meeting. He was the bearer of an
order to nominate six persons, from whom the king would
choose the two general deputies. This election had up to
this period been made by the political assemblies, and the
synod alleged the text of the last edict, which prescribed to
it to occupy itself solely with affairs of doctrine and discipline.
But the court, without having expressly stated it in
the last treaties, did not intend to permit the holding of any
more political assemblies, and compelled the synod to exceed
its powers, while it restricted it with inflexible rigour upon
other questions. Thus the council supported or overturned
the letter of the laws according to the object of the moment—the
universal and perpetual practice of the strong.</p>

<p>The synod of Castres made deep complaints concerning
the unhappy condition of the churches. It said to Louis XIII.
“that his subjects of the Reformed religion were molested in
many parts of the kingdom, obstructed in the exercise of
their religion, and deprived of their places of worship; that
even their cemeteries had been taken away from them, and
the corpses disinterred with the extremest indignity; that
their ministers had been cruelly treated, beaten, wounded,
and driven out of their churches, although they were quite
innocent, wronging neither the public in general, nor any
person in particular.”</p>

<p>While the court gave the Reformers satisfaction upon a
few secondary points, it prepared a formidable expedition
against their last stronghold. The Cardinal de Richelieu,
who became a member of the council in the year 1624,
planned the establishment of the absolute authority of the
king upon the ruins of La Rochelle. The design was no
longer concealed. Louis XIII. announced it to the pope,
who had exhibited great vexation at the news of the new
treaty with the Huguenots. The priests published the near
triumph of the (Roman) Catholic faith, and the archbishop
of Lyons wrote to Richelieu, “We must lay siege to La
Rochelle, and chastise, or to speak plainly, exterminate
the Huguenots, whatever else be left undone.”</p>

<p>The commune of La Rochelle enjoyed privileges far
anterior to the period of the Reformation. Eléonore d’Aquitaine
had in the twelfth century conferred important liberties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
upon it. The burgesses governed themselves. They
named a town council, consisting of the mayor, twenty-four
aldermen, and seventy-five peers. These hundred magistrates,
or <i lang="fr">prud’hommes</i>, had troops, a navy, a treasury of their
own, and very extensive rights of jurisdiction. La Rochelle
was rather annexed than united to France, and its position
resembled that of the free towns of Germany.</p>

<p>To justify its pretensions, it declared that it had given
itself freely to Charles V., with the express reservation of all
its franchises and immunities, and the people of La Rochelle
remembered with pride, that they had exacted from
Louis XI. the solemn sanction of their rights. “Louis XI.,”
says the historian of that city, “made his entry into La
Rochelle the 24th of May (1472). He swore to preserve
the privileges of the town; he took the oath on bended
knees, with one hand upon the cross and the other upon the
Holy Gospel, which the mayor held before him.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>A governor resided at La Rochelle in the name of the
king, but the burghers did not allow him to introduce a
strong garrison, nor to build a citadel. Its real chief was the
mayor, who was chosen every year. The inhabitants were
rich, industrious, intelligent, and excellent seamen; they
numbered from twenty-five to thirty thousand souls.</p>

<p>The Reformation was certain of finding an easy entrance
into their town; for wherever there were intelligence and
freedom, the gates were opened to them beforehand. From the
year 1557, it was known at La Rochelle. “This first beginning
was so favoured of God,” says Theodore de Bèze, “that
in a short time a great part of the town abandoned the
superstitions of the Romish church, the Lord preparing
thenceforth this place whereby to sustain on a future day
the direst efforts of His adversaries.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>La Rochelle was several times besieged during the religious
wars, without having been ever taken. Condé, Coligny,
Jeanne d’Albret, and Henry of Béarn, found within its walls
a secure refuge. The political assemblies were held there in
the most troublous times. It was, in a word, the firmest rampart
and the great stronghold of the French Reformation,
since the north and the centre of the kingdom could afford
it a rallying-point no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>The independence of La Rochelle was even important for
the noblemen of the (Roman) Catholic party, because it
offered them a means of driving the crown to buy of them
more dearly the succour they lent it, and of keeping the last
remains of their feudal prerogatives safe. “We shall not be
so foolish,” said one of them, “as to take La Rochelle;” and
the Cardinal de Richelieu made this remark: “The greatest
difficulty that I see in the design, is that most of them will
labour by way of acquittal and with little affection.”</p>

<p>After the peace of 1622, the court had ordered the construction
of a fort near La Rochelle, notwithstanding the
petitions of the inhabitants, and the promise which had been
given them, that their privileges should be respected. Out
of this, continual collisions by sea and land had arisen, which
produced no decisive result until the year 1627.</p>

<p>Richelieu at length sought to strike a great blow, by employing
all the power of his genius and all the resources of
the crown. He staked his political fortune upon the capture
of La Rochelle, persuaded that if he succeeded in this expedition,
he should break up the Huguenot party, reduce the
first houses of the kingdom, and leave in France one dominant
power alone—royalty.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_VI">VI.</h3>
</div>


<p>The siege of La Rochelle began in 1627, and lasted more
than a year before attentive Europe. The king of England
promised to the inhabitants both his aid and credit. Thrice
his fleet appeared in sight of the port; but the first time it
could not take the citadel of the Isle of Ré; the second time
it did not succeed in relieving the place, and the third, it
seemed to have come only to assist at the ruin of the town.
It was suspected that the duke of Buckingham had betrayed
the cause of the Reformed communion, and that Charles I.
shared in these disloyal manœuvres under the influence of
his wife, Henrietta of France. The Puritans of England did
not forget this grievance, when they drew up the account of
the acts of that unfortunate prince in 1649.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Richelieu constructed a dike in the sea,
as Alexander did before Tyre, and shut up the besieged in
an inclosure continually narrowing. He was at the same
time admiral, chief engineer, and generalissimo; he superintended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
and directed everything, leaving to Louis XIII. only
the vain pleasure of the chase, or of touching the sick at the
grand <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> of the Church. People cited the miracles of the
king with admiration; those of the cardinal were more
authentic and more useful to the monarchy.</p>

<p>We have a journal written by one of the besieged, Pierre
Méruault, son of the chief of the artillery of the garrison.
He relates the sufferings of the inhabitants with minuteness.
As the mole gradually rose before the port, the dearth increased.
It became horrible from the month of June, 1628.
From two to three hundred persons died every day. The
famished had acquired so sad an experience of this kind of
death, that they could foresee the very hour, and moment,
when they would cease to live, and give directions for their
own burial.</p>

<p>They were driven, in this extreme distress, to send bands
of children, women, and old men, from the town. Louis XIII.
was not so generous as his father, Henry IV., at the siege of
Paris. He ordered their repulse without pity, and even
caused his soldiers to fire against some of these poor creatures,
who stopped to pluck roots and herbs upon the glacis, or
to gather shell-fish left by the ebbing of the tide. He commanded,
also, that some crops of beans, which the besieged
had grown at the foot of their counterscarps, should be
destroyed.</p>

<p>Many of the fugitives, urged by the inexorable voice of
hunger, continuing to present themselves at the royal camp,
gallows were erected for their summary execution; and when
they came in too great numbers, lots were drawn for those
who were to undergo this punishment. Others, despoiled of
their clothes, were beaten and hunted out by the soldiers
with rods and leathern thongs. The desire was, by sending
them back into the town, that there might be more people
to press upon the scanty stores.</p>

<p>Where were the co-religionists of the inhabitants of La
Rochelle? What were they doing in this last struggle for
their political existence? The Duke de Rohan went to
Uzès, to Milhau, to Nismes, to Cevennes, from one end of
Languedoc to the other, exhorting the Huguenots to rise for
the common cause. His efforts were useless; he found none
but timid spirits and cold hearts, or consciences gained by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
the favour of the court. He repeated the motto, of which
his mother, the dowager-duchess of Rohan, had reminded
him from the bottom of her asylum at La Rochelle: “<em>Complete
victory, certain peace, or honourable death</em>;” instead of
arming and following him, he was met by every one of them
with recrimination.</p>

<p>He thus complained of this inertness in the preface to his
<cite>Memoirs</cite>; his language, though bitter, is that of the chief of
a falling party; but it serves to paint the aspect of the
epoch: “In the two former wars, divisions appeared in some
quarters; in the latter, it burst out on every side, there
being no place into which corruption had not entered, and
where avarice had not appeared above piety, to such an
extent, that, without tarrying for our enemy’s seeking, men
hastened to prostitute themselves by selling their religion,
and betraying their party. Our fathers would have destroyed
their children in the cradle, had they foreseen that they
would become the instruments of the ruin of the churches,
which they founded by the glare of the martyr-pyre, and
cemented with their blood.”</p>

<p>Deducting from these accusations what has been exaggerated
by the irritation of defeat, it remains true that the great
mass of the Reformers did not take part in this last war;
some, as we have already explained, on account of the national
impulse which induced entire submission to the royal authority;
others, because they were weary of struggles which cost so
many lives, and produced no good; some, because they did
not perceive the bond that united their religious liberty to
their political security; others, again, through indifference,
through venality, or through that kind of prudence which is
keener to see the greatness of the peril, than the means of
eluding it.</p>

<p>The thing is notable; for many historians say that the
whole Reformed population rose against the crown in 1628,
and was defeated. These historians are in error: the majority
of the Calvinists refused to arm. If it be a title of
honour to have thus acted, let them have it; if it be a disgrace,
let them bear its weight.</p>

<p>The people of La Rochelle, however, continued to perform
prodigies of valour and heroism under the leadership of their
mayor, Jean Guiton, a brave and inflexible old seaman, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
had said: “If there should be no more than one townsman
left, it will still be his duty to keep the gates closed.”</p>

<p>At length, when every hope of succour from without or
within had departed, when two-thirds of the population had
fallen, when the streets and the houses were choked with
corpses, which none had sufficient strength left to inter;
when scarcely a man was to be found, who was able to bear
the weight of arms, or to walk without a staff, the town surrendered.
This happened on the 28th October, 1628. On
that day the Reformers of France fell powerless before
their enemies, and were never able to raise themselves again
until one hundred and sixty years afterwards, when the
principles of 1789 released them.</p>

<p>Misfortune had not cast down the courage of the men of
La Rochelle, and it is a matter of astonishment that Richelieu,
who had the capacity to understand great things, should
have done them so little justice. “The audacity that ever
accompanies rebellion,” says he in his Memoirs, “was so
deeply impressed upon the minds of these wretches, that
although they were but the shadows of living men, and had
no hope of life, except from the king’s clemency, of which
they were unworthy, they nevertheless dared even then to
propose to the cardinal that they would make a general
treaty for the whole party of the Calvinists.” This proved
that they were less careful, in their adversity, concerning
their own fate than with reference to that of their co-religionists.</p>

<p>A declaration of the king, published on the 10th November,
ordained the re-establishment at La Rochelle of the exercise
of the (Roman) Catholic religion, and the restitution
to the clergy of their churches and their property. A place
of worship was to be designated for the Reformers. The
privileges of the town were abolished, its franchises annulled,
and its fortifications demolished, except those facing the sea.
The Cardinal de Richelieu and the bishop Henri de Sourdis,
who had plied the trade of the soldier during the siege,
celebrated the first mass at La Rochelle, after having purified
the churches. Perhaps the hands which had just quitted
the sword, ought to have been first purified themselves before
touching the host of the <em>Prince of peace</em>. But the history
of mankind is replete with such violent contradictions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>There were great rejoicings at Rome upon the reduction
of La Rochelle. Pope Urban VIII. sang a solemn <i lang="la">Te Deum</i>,
made an extraordinary distribution of indulgences, and addressed
to the king briefs of the most flattering kind. “Great
prince,” he thus apostrophized Louis XIII., “God sits upon
your right hand. May He ever aid and sustain the power
and strength of your spear!”</p>

<p>The Duke de Rohan kept the field in the south, until the
middle of the following year. He displayed courage, constancy,
and self-denial, worthy of a better fate. An assembly
of provincial deputies, convoked at Nismes, energetically
protested against the overthrow of the political guarantee
of the Reformation. It was too late. The Calvinist party
had ceased to exist. Each town and village refused obedience
to the assembly, and claimed to transact its affairs by itself:
then division, defections, and treason, completed the ruin of
the general cause.</p>

<p>The royal army presented itself before the little town of
Privas, in the month of May, 1629. The inhabitants, seized
with terror, amounting to a panic, fled to the fields; and the
garrison, which retired to the fort, were soon forced to capitulate.
At the moment of the troops entering, the explosion
of a powder-magazine caused the suspicion of an ambush.
The eight hundred Huguenot soldiers forming the garrison
were murdered, fifty burghers hanged, the others sent to the
galleys, the town sacked and burnt, and the property of the
inhabitants confiscated to the crown. The missionaries, who
followed in the rear of the army to convert the heretics,
ascribed this catastrophe to the <em>anger of God</em>.</p>

<p>The merciless butchery at Privas spread consternation and
dismay. The king marched upon Cevennes without meeting
with any resistance; and the Duke de Rohan, seeing
that the affairs of his party were desperate, sued for peace,
in concert with the general assembly transferred to Anduze.
Richelieu imposed as the first condition, that all the fortifications
of the Huguenot towns should be razed to the
ground. Anduze, and the province of Cevennes, submitted
after some difficulty; and the king, being then at Nismes,
published the <cite>Edict of Grace</cite>, in the month of July, 1629.</p>

<p>The name alone of this edict marked a new order of
things. It was no longer a pacification—it was a <em>grace</em>, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
grace granted by the good-will of the sovereign to his vanquished
subjects. The preamble spoke of nothing but their
<em>rebellion</em>, and of the goodness of the king: “to which we
are the more easily disposed,” Louis XIII. was made to say,
“because we have been desirous, by a rare instance of
clemency, after so many relapses, the more advantageously
to win the hearts of our subjects, spare the effusion of blood,
the devastation of the province, and all the disorders and
calamities of war; and we are moved to this solely by compassion
for their misery and love for their well-being.”</p>

<p>The Reformers were reinstated in the possession of their
places of worship, their cemeteries, and the exercise of their
religion in the places they had before used, pending their
return to the bosom of the (Roman) Catholic church, “in
which,” adds Louis XIII., “for more than eleven hundred
successive years, the kings, our predecessors, have lived without
interruption or change; there being no possible way of
so well testifying to the affection we bear them, than by
desiring to find them in the same road of salvation that we
keep and follow ourselves.”</p>

<p>There was a threat expressed in this hope, and the priests
did not fail to avail themselves of it at the opportune time.
There was also, as we shall see, a pretence of the Cardinal
de Richelieu, who, aspiring to every kind of glory, flattered
himself that he would be able to unite the two religions.</p>

<p>The conditions of the Edict of Grace were less severe than
had been feared, except as regarded the political guarantees,
and some authors have loudly extolled the clemency of the
cardinal. If it be sought to establish the opinion that he
was more tolerant than other churchmen, because he had
more genius, and that he was a better statesman, we shall
accord with such an opinion without difficulty. But it must
not be forgotten that Richelieu, being leagued with the Swedish
and German Protestants for the humiliation of the house of
Austria by the sword of Gustavus Adolphus, could not treat
the French Reformers with excessive rigour. Nor must it
be forgotten that, in France itself, having to combat against
the great (Roman) Catholic noblemen, against the king’s
brother, the queen-mother, and the reigning queen, the prime
minister of Louis XIII. would have been mad to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
pushed a whole people to despair, who, in a case of extremity,
might have compromised his fortunes and those of the kingdom
itself. Richelieu was generous perhaps, but he was,
above all, prudent.</p>

<p>The town of Montauban was the last to submit. It remembered
with pride the heroic resistance it had opposed
to the royal troops, and its inhabitants, accustomed to self-government
from the commencement of the religious wars,
felt a great repugnance to “<em>return to their duty</em>,” as the
phrase then was. Two deputies came from Nismes with an
envoy of Richelieu, to exhort them to submission. The
people wished to preserve their ramparts: they obtained
nothing, and the most determined at length perceived that
to continue the struggle had become impossible.</p>

<p>Montauban opened its gates; and on the 21st August, 1629,
its inhabitants witnessed the entry of Marshal de Bassompierre,
with a part of the army, the pope’s nuncio, the first
president of the Parliament of Toulouse, and lastly, Cardinal
de Richelieu, who presented himself as one who had gained
a triumph. When the ministers of the religion came to
pay their respects to him, he consented to receive them, “<em>not
as forming a church body</em>,” he told them, “<em>but as a people
following the profession of letters</em>.” This was indeed carrying
fiction a little too far.</p>

<p>He celebrated mass in one of the churches of Montauban,
instituted convents for the Jesuits and Capuchins, and
ordered the demolition of the walls. Then he resumed his
journey to Paris, surrounded with more homage than
Louis XIII. himself ever received from his people.</p>

<p>The Duke de Rohan was the object of the attack of his
co-religionists, who, becoming unjust by reason of their misfortune,
accused him of being the author of all their calamities.
He wrote his apology with the satisfaction of a good
conscience, and concluded it in these terms: “These are my
crimes, for which I have been condemned at Toulouse to be
dragged to pieces by four horses, whereof I take glory to
myself.... I wish those who come after me may have
the same affection, fidelity, and patience that I have had;
that they may meet with people more constant, less covetous,
and more zealous than I have done; and that God may bless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
them with greater prosperity, to the end that by restoring
the churches of France, they may execute that which I
dared to undertake.”</p>

<p>His hopes were realized otherwise than he had any notion
of. Henri de Rohan was the last warrior-chief of the French
Reformation; but that which the sword has not effected,
civilization and liberty have accomplished in the day of
God’s destiny.</p>

<p>Rohan offered his sword to the republic of Venice, and
afterwards to Gustavus Adolphus, and died in 1638, on the
plains of Germany, for the same cause, which he had so long
and so valiantly defended in his own country.</p>

<h3 id="BIII_VII">VII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Calvinist party had definitively ceased to exist after
the taking of La Rochelle, and the history of the Reformers
is no longer mixed up with the great affairs of the kingdom,
until the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>It was in vain that persons of the highest birth, who
belonged to the (Roman) Catholic communion, provoked
them to resort to arms; Huguenots were no longer to be
found in the ranks of the adversaries of royalty.</p>

<p>In 1632, the Duke Henri de Montmorency, supported by
Gaston d’Orléans, brother of Louis XIII., essayed to re-awaken
the religious passions in Languedoc, where he was
governor. He addressed himself to the noblemen of the
religion, to the pastors, the consistories, and the synods, and
met with nothing but refusals. He had five or six bishops
in his party, but not a single Reformer. The second consul
of Nismes preserved the town for the king, by expelling the
bishop and the first consul, who was a (Roman) Catholic.
The inhabitants of Montauban offered to march against the
troops of Montmorency, and, memorable fact! the miserable
remnants of the population of Privas defended their town
for the service of the king, and Cardinal de Richelieu could
but say of the Reformers, “They have done more than all
the rest.”</p>

<p>About twenty years afterwards, during the troubles of
the Fronde, the great Condé, counting upon the old associations
of his house, sought to attract them to his standard,
and employed emissaries, who sowed sinister rumours. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
went from church to church, saying that the regent Anne
d’Autriche, had promised the clergy that the Edict of Pacification
should be revoked, that her first minister, Mazarin,
was an Italian cardinal without good faith, that it was force
alone which would preserve the Reformers from utter ruin,
and that the Prince de Condé would guarantee full liberty
of conscience and of worship. But these appeals were also
fruitless.</p>

<p>The people of La Rochelle took the side of the regent
against their own governor. Those of Montauban exhausted
their men and wealth for the same purpose. The town of
Saint Jean d’Angély, which had nothing but dismantled
walls, defended itself against the rebels. The province of the
Vivarais and the Cevennes furnished devoted soldiers, and
nearly all the Reformed nobility of the southern provinces,
rising against the Prince de Condé, kept Languedoc, Saintonge,
and a part of Guienne for the king.</p>

<p>These services were of great importance; Mazarin said, “I
have no cause to complain of the little flock; if they browse
on bad herbage, at least they do not stray away.” When he
mentioned the pastors of Montauban, he styled them his
good friends, and the Count d’Harcourt said to the deputies
of the same town, “The crown tottered on the king’s head,
but you have fixed it there.”</p>

<p>Louis XIV. expressed his gratitude more than once, but
particularly in his declaration of the 21st of May, 1682, in
which he said, “Forasmuch as our subjects of the pretended
Reformed religion have given us proofs of their affection
and fidelity, notably in the present circumstances, of which
we rest well satisfied, we make known that for these causes
they be maintained and guarded, as now we maintain and
guard them, in the full and entire enjoyment of the Edict
of Nantes.”</p>

<p>But it was this very same king, who made those who had
fixed the crown upon his head, to suffer the longest and the
more odious persecutions! It was he who in 1685 signed
the fatal Edict of Revocation! What were the causes of so
many violences and misfortunes? We are about to enter on
one of the most interesting problems of this history.</p>

<p>The most implacable enemy of the Reformed was the
spiritual power. In the foremost rank the Jesuits figured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
who had purposely been created for the extirpation of Protestantism
in Europe, the born adversaries of the Huguenots,
monks doubly redoubtable by their office of confessors to
kings, and because their code of morality authorized them
the use of any and every means. Lying, deceit, iniquity, the
traffic of consciences, brutal force, spoliations, exile, even
murder,—all things were lawful, provided they only conduced
to their ends.</p>

<p>After the Jesuits came the secular clergy, who—except a
few, such as Richelieu and Mazarin, who were rather politicians
than ecclesiastics—were never weary of inventing new
measures of oppression and persecution against heretics.
They had the advantage over the poor and humble ministers
of the French Reformation, of number, birth, position, authority,
fortune, and high offices, and might do anything to
crush them without fear of reprisals.</p>

<p>Every five years the secular clergy held assemblies, which
were never dissolved, as we have already remarked, without
the repeal of some portion of the laws of toleration. “The
clergy,” says Rulhières, “gave the king money. His servants
negotiated with this first body of the state, to obtain
for the requirements of the kingdom, what was called the
<em>gratuitous gift</em>; and the Protestants, on the contrary, wanted
money from the king for the maintenance of their ministers
and the holding of their synods. Each time they wished to
meet, it was a pecuniary favour they solicited, and each time
that the clergy assembled, it was a kind of favour that they
conferred upon the state. Consequently each assembly of
the clergy was distinguished by some advantage gained over
the Reformed, while each synod, on the contrary, received
from the court some mark of disfavour.... The demands
of the clergy were in a degree moderate, so long as the
Calvinists were to be feared; but they extended to open
persecution as soon as the Calvinists had become peaceable
citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, after the Jesuits and the (secular) clergy, swarmed
legions of Capuchins, Recollets, Carmelites, Franciscans,
and others; an ignorant and reckless horde, who fanned
the fanaticism of the populace, and were ever ready to attack
heresy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>So much for the spiritual authority! As for the men of
the temporal power, the foremost adversaries of the Reformation
were the kings themselves, who had received a false and
imperfect education. Their preceptors had placed them as
much as possible under the yoke of a narrow and intolerant
devotion, that was full of little scruples upon certain points,
and easy of relaxation upon others. Louis XIII. had neither
greatness of mind, nor dignity of character. A weak, hypochondriac
prince, putting his kingdom under the protection
of the Virgin, after assassinating the favorites of his mother,
he possessed no other merit than that of allowing himself to
be governed by Richelieu. Louis XIV., with a proud genius
and true kingly qualities, united gallantry to bigotry, and
we shall have occasion to see that in his strange compromises
with his conscience, the more scandal he occasioned to his
court by his licentiousness, the more he made it a point to
edify it by his severity against the Reformed.</p>

<p>Each of these kings held the policy of weakening
Calvinism as a state maxim, as if men and circumstances
were the same as they had been under Charles IX. These
princes had been taught that the Reformation was the
enemy of thrones, and they thought they could never do
enough against this vain phantom of their imagination.</p>

<p>The result was, that the chief employments at court and
in the army, of the magistracy and the finances, were systematically
refused to the Calvinists, except in extraordinary
cases. Turenne and Duquesne broke through this barrier
by the splendour of their services; the others were left disregarded,
or condemned to grow grey in inferior situations.
The Edict of Nantes had, no doubt, made the Reformed
admissible to office, but it did not guarantee to them the
favours of the court; “and royalty,” to use the expression of
Louis XIV. himself, “restricted them to the narrowest limits
that justice and a regard for appearances would permit.”
Even these conditions, however, were not long respected.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. has, moreover, said, in the memoirs which he
dictated for the instruction of the dauphin: “As for the
favours that depended upon me alone, I resolved, and I have
punctually kept that resolution ever since, not to grant any
to the people of that religion, and this out of kindness, and
not from hatred, that they might be obliged thereby to consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
from time to time by themselves, and <em>apart from
violence</em>, whether they were acting wisely in voluntarily
depriving themselves of the advantages they might enjoy in
common with my other subjects.” Nothing can be more
<i lang="fr">naïf</i> and instructive than these avowals.</p>

<p>The ministers of state naturally followed the bent of the
prince. No favour [was to be allowed] to heretics; ill-will
[was to be accorded,] when it was possible [to manifest it]
without too open an attack upon acquired rights; and a constant
inequality of treatment, that urged the lukewarm and
the ambitious to change their religion.</p>

<p>The intendants of the provinces—the new creation of a
government, that aspired to a stronger national unity—anxious
to make themselves agreeable to the court and the
council, did not omit to pronounce for the Jesuits against
the pastors, and for the bishops against the provincial synods
or the consistories, whenever there was a pretext, however
frivolous, that could be made available.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Parliaments pursued the same course, not
through religious fanaticism, but through that spirit which
in all ages, among the Pagans as in Christendom, has constituted
the magistracy the guardians of ancient laws and traditional
customs. The advocate-general, Omer Talon, said,
in the great days of Poitiers, in 1634, that the pretended
Reformed, being only suffered by toleration, the matters
regarding them ought not to be counted as <em>favourable</em>, and
that the most rigorous interpretation ought, on the contrary,
to be applied against them.</p>

<p>Thus in the questions brought before the tribunals, they
could only count upon the strict right, or rather upon what
it was not possible to deny to them without flagrant injustice.
Out of every severe decree, a hostile law immediately
arose against them, and by one restriction and another, they
successively lost what the Edict of Nantes had conceded
to them.</p>

<p>The universities and colleges, where clerical influence was
dominant, invented difficulty upon difficulty, against conferring
academic degrees upon the <em>religionists</em>, and at length
these degrees were only granted upon certificates of attendance
at mass.</p>

<p>As for the relations between private individuals of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
two religions, there is a distinction to be drawn. The men
of letters, and the people of the middle class, the <em>respectable
folks</em>—to use the language of the period—generally lived on
good terms with each other. We know that the French
Academy was founded by members of both communions.
Such was also the origin of many learned societies, at Nismes
and elsewhere. “Long before the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes,” says Segrais, “the (Roman) Catholics and Huguenots
lived here [at Caen] on good terms; they ate, drank,
played, and took their amusements together, and left each
other freely, some for the mass, others for the sermon, without
any scandal on one side or the other.”</p>

<p>But in the body of the people, more subjected to the
teaching of the priesthood, prejudices and hatreds were rife.
Whence resulted vexatious interferences with the rights of
freedom, local privileges, as the corporations of trades, and
in the small appointments in the gift of the municipal councils.
Whence also arose acts of violence on the least pretence,
against the places of worship, against the property,
against the persons; and when it was dared, attacks became
more regular and more general, and were habitually headed
by some ignorant parish vicar, or some abject monk.</p>

<p>By what has been said, we may judge of the condition of
the Reformed after the Edict of Grace. They had, at intervals,
days of repose, which permitted them to apply themselves
to theological learning, to develop their ordinary
instruction, and to cultivate the industrial arts. But this
rest was uncertain, this calm unquiet, so to speak, and persecution
soon went on increasing, until the favourable moment
appeared for the annihilation of the French Reformation.
We shall only relate what is most important.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_VIII">VIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Cardinal de Richelieu, who had written a method of controversies,
in the leisure moments of his youth, was bent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
upon the execution of his plan of reunion. He thereupon
sounded the pastors and the provincial synods, by means of
his confidant Father Joseph, a mysterious personage, an
emissary at once intriguing, active, and unscrupulous; he
was seconded in his work by a certain Théophile de la Milletière,
an equivocal Calvinist, and a writer of but little
learning, who was ambitious to gain a name by promoting
designs of which he did not comprehend the object.</p>

<p>Among the persons who were captivated by this project,
were the prudent and skilful, who were desirous of abandoning
a religion—if they could do so without dishonour—so
little agreeable to [those in] power, as well as simple people,
who foolishly believed that (Roman) Catholicism was willing
to make serious concessions, no less than some other good
folks, who treated the whole matter as a question of charity.
In the number of these last, a man of merit, Petit, pastor
and professor of theology at Nismes, was for some time
found.</p>

<p>However, it soon appeared, that under the pompous word
reunion, nothing else was dreamed of than an act of repentance
on the part of the Calvinists, and of gracious amnesty
on that of the (Roman) Catholics—a no more considerable
change than that of a few terms, which shocked the
ear of the disciples of Calvin. Certain pastors were to be
gained beforehand, who, for form’s sake, should hold a disputation
with (Roman) Catholic doctors in the king’s presence,
and should oppose no strong objection. Then they
were to demand admittance as penitents, and the Church of
Rome, like a good mother, would receive them with open
arms. Lastly, a meeting, filled with people of this easy
mould, was to be got together in a national synod; and when
once the project of reunion was officially announced, material
force was to be employed to compel the submission of
the recalcitrants, or to expel them from the kingdom.</p>

<p>The plan was skilfully conceived: the only flaw, however,
was the omission to take honourable and faithful consciences
into the account. It failed. The pastors displayed
<em>obstinacy</em>, and, what is remarkable, the laity were even
more obstinate than their ministers. Not one provincial
synod entered into the plot. Petit acknowledged his error;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
La Milletière was excommunicated, and immediately became
a (Roman) Catholic; Richelieu had other matters to attend
to, and the idea of the reunion was abandoned, to be again
attempted on two or three occasions before the Revocation.</p>

<p>The clergy went a different way to exterminate heresy,
namely, by means of missionaries, ambulating controversialists,
otherwise called <em>converters</em>, or <em>propagators of the
faith</em>, whom we find at work from the year 1630. Some of
them were monks, Capuchins and Recollets, of whom Fénélon
somewhere says, that they had drawn universal contempt
upon themselves by their ignorance and their fanatical rage.
The others were laymen of the lowest condition—cordwainers,
brokers, tailors, itinerant grinders, little shopmen—who, without
any study, abandoned their trade for the championship
of the (Roman) Catholic faith.</p>

<p>These vagabonds received a fixed sum <em>per</em> head, for every
proselyte, and the rate varied according to the importance
of the convert. They were careful to take certificates duly
legalized, of their conquests, so that they might insure
the receipt of their money. Fraud soon entered into the
transaction, as might have been expected. There were
wretches who joined the Reformed communion for the express
purpose of deserting it, or feigned to belong to it that
they might abjure, and afterwards share [the proceeds of
their iniquity] with their accomplices.</p>

<p>The converters had learned a catalogue of ridiculous subtilties
and gross quibbles by heart, which they retailed on
all occasions. The refutation of what was least ignoble in
these polemics, was made with a master’s hand by the
pastor Drelincourt, in his <cite lang="fr">Abrégé des Controverses</cite>, whence
he was called the scourge of the propagators of the faith.</p>

<p>One of their favourite arguments consisted in putting
this question: “Do you believe that the king is idolatrous
and damned?” If the answer was “yes,” the result became
a serious affair, pregnant with grave consequences, particularly
for those who held any public appointment. If the
reply was in the negative, they then asked how it was that
any one could refuse to enter a church that opened the door
of salvation. Or, again, if they encountered a strong
resistance, they pushed their interlocutor to utter irreverent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
words against the Virgin and the saints; and as the laws
punished what was then styled blasphemy, they denounced
the offenders.</p>

<p>As they had the priests and the Jesuits for their protectors,
the majority of these “converters” were no less
insolent than illiterate. They ran from town to town,
knocking at the doors of consistories and synods. They
even made their way, by force, into private houses, sometimes
by the assistance of the judges of the district, and
commenced a controversy, according to rule. So long as
they were civilly invited to withdraw, they held firm. But
if in a moment of anger they were thrust out, they sought
to excite their unwilling host to some act of violence before
witnesses, in the open street, and immediately carried their
complaint before a tribunal.</p>

<p>Many carried their impudence to such an extent as to
interrupt the pastors in full assembly, and to give them the
lie. These unworthy excesses exposed them to no more than
murmurs and words of reprehension. People dared not chastise
them as they deserved. If an assembly, less enduring than
others, thrust them into the street and a tumult resulted,
the consequence was the interdiction of religious worship, or
even the imprisonment of the pastor.</p>

<p>Stalls were erected at the crossways; and there these
new mountebanks, with piles of great books at their sides,
of which they had not read a word, blattered away upon
points of controversy, parodied the ministers, and diverted
or excited the populace by their vociferations.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of these “converters” was one Véron,
or Father Véron. He had worn the habit of a Jesuit, and
had been presented with the curacy of Charenton, that he
might more conveniently importune the Reformed. This
Véron frequently attended the sermons of the pastors, and
at the end of the service refuted them on a kind of stage he
had caused to be erected at the door of his church. He
wearied the most learned doctors of the Reformation with
his challenges. The celebrated Bochart had on one occasion
the complaisance to open a regular disputation with him.
But Véron fled before the questions, which he had himself
placed upon the table, were examined, and the pastors ended
by opposing him with the silence of contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>All these endeavours after conversions had but little success.
Not only studious men, but artisans, women, nay even
children of the Reformed communion, made themselves masters
of controversial subjects, and easily confounded the self-styled
propagators of the faith. So also, after the pacific
mission came the armed mission—the <em>booted</em> mission, of
which we shall speak in its place.</p>

<p>From 1631 to 1645 three national synods were held.
The court strove to render them less and less frequent, until
it might succeed wholly in suppressing them. The first of
these assemblies was opened at Charenton, on the 1st of
September, 1631. The commissioner Galland took his seat
without opposition. Pastors and laity, all were of a sorrowful
heart, and [maintained an] humble attitude: they felt
they were at the mercy of their opponents.</p>

<p>The king disgraced the general deputies, whose nomination
would be agreeable to himself, and the synod obeyed. Later,
one single deputy only was required, the formality of whose
re-election was even dispensed with. This high office was
concentrated in the family of the Marquis de Ruvigny,
and the churches vainly sought to join a general deputy
from the <i lang="fr">Tiers-état</i> with him. The liberal spirit of the
Reformation did not suit Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The synod of Charenton declared itself against any projects
of reconciliation with the (Roman) Catholics; but it
offered the hand of fellowship to the Lutherans, who until
then had not been admitted to the Supper of the Calvinists.
“Because the churches of the Confession of Augsburg,” it
said, “agree with the other Reformed churches in the fundamental
points of true religion, and because there is neither
superstition nor idolatry in their worship, the faithful of the
said confession, who through a spirit of friendship and peace,
shall join the communion of our churches in this kingdom,
may, without making any abjuration, be received at the
table of the Lord.”</p>

<p>The king would vouchsafe no answer to the list of grievances
drawn up at Charenton, until after the separation of
the synod: “In order,” he said, “that he might treat with
his subjects more suitably to his sovereign dignity and the
sacred authority of his word.” We may recognise in this
(answer) both the genius and accent of Richelieu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Another national synod was opened in the month of May,
1637, in the town of Alençon. M. de Saint Marc, a councillor
of state and a royal commissioner, addressed it in a
high tone: “I am come to your synod to make known to
you the will of his majesty. All authority is of God, and
consequently, on this immoveable basis, you are bound to
obey. Besides that the goodness of his majesty obliges you
to obedience, as well as the care he takes of you, his clemency
and his power are the firmest supports you can have. I have
not the slightest doubt that you have often reflected upon
the admirable providence of God, which has so ordered that
the royal authority is your preservation.” The moderator,
Basnage, replied to M. de Saint Marc, that the churches had
never had the least thought of departing from that submission,
to which the Word of God bound them.</p>

<p>The king (now) forbade the pastors and elders to correspond
between synod to synod, or with foreign ecclesiastical
bodies; and as many letters had arrived from Geneva and
Holland, they were given up sealed to the commissioner, who,
after having ascertained their contents, permitted that they
should be read to the meeting. These letters treated upon
some points of doctrine raised by Amyrant, a professor
of the academy of Saumur. We shall return to them by-and-by.</p>

<p>The synod engaged itself upon the question of negro
slavery, a matter little agitated in the seventeenth century,
and which did not at all excite the attention of the assemblies
of the (Roman) Catholic clergy. If it was of opinion
that the Word of God does not prohibit the buying and keeping
of slaves, it at least laid down conditions very far in
advance of that epoch: “This assembly, confirming the canon
framed by the provincial synod of Normandy, exhorted the
faithful not to abuse this liberty in a manner contrary to the
rules of Christian charity, and not to replace these unbelievers
in the power of the barbarians, who might treat them inhumanly,
or in that of those who were cruel; but to give
them to kind-hearted Christians, who might chiefly be in a
condition to take care of their precious and immortal souls,
by endeavouring to instruct them in the religion of Christ.”</p>

<p>A third national synod was held at Charenton, at the end
of the year 1644, shortly after the death of Cardinal de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Richelieu and of Louis XIII. The king’s commissioner
took the singular part of being the first to complain of the
encroachments and usurpations of the Reformed churches, in
order, apparently, to prevent the Reformed from making
reclamations against the injustice and indignities which they
suffered. He then made known the wishes of the king,
among which was the order to exclude any from the ministry
of the Gospel who had studied at Geneva, in Holland, or in
England, because of the republican spirit which prevailed
in those countries. This was the period of the struggles of
Cromwell and the Puritans against Charles I.</p>

<p>There was, on the reports of some deputies from the
maritime provinces, a question about the <em>Independents</em>, who
had come from England and settled in France. They were
accused of teaching that each flock ought to be self-governed,
without any regard to the authority of conferences and
synods. The assembly, considering this opinion to be prejudicial
to the interests of the Church of God, and to those
of the state, enjoined upon the maritime provinces, that they
should prevent this evil from taking root in the kingdom.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_IX">IX.</h3>
</div>


<p>From 1652 to 1656, the situation of the Reformed was
satisfactory. Mazarin was pleased with the fidelity they had
shown during the troubles of the Fronde. He was also
desirous, by treating them well, to conciliate the friendship of
Cromwell, who by inclining to the side of France or of Spain,
then at war with each other, might throw a decisive weight
into the scale.</p>

<p>The free exercise of religion was therefore re-established
in many places where it had been suppressed, contrary to the
texts of the edicts. The Reformed were restored to municipal
offices; some were intrusted with important appointments
in the finances and the army. The declaration of
1652, which we have already had occasion to mention, confirmed
the Edict of Nantes, and regulations, articles, and
patents passed in favour of the Reformed. Never since the
reign of Henry IV. had they breathed so freely, or enjoyed
greater protection.</p>

<p>This time was to be of short duration. The assembly of
the clergy, which met in 1656, pronounced, through their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
organ, the archbishop of Sens, bitter complaints against
what they called the <em>oppression</em> of the (Roman) Catholic
church. As the priests could not be persecutors, they declared
that they were persecuted. They did not, of course,
demand the revocation of the edicts; but they required the
re-establishment of “<em>legitimate interpretations, which had been
put upon them by the late king</em>.” They grieved to see that
heretics “had by new enterprises ruined all the wise precautions
with which the great prince (Louis XIII.) had stopped
the restlessness of their minds,” and supposed that the declaration
of 1652 had been a surprise made upon the piety of
Louis XIV. and his prime minister.</p>

<p>As the Reformed had built some places of worship belonging
to a commander of Malta and to other ecclesiastical
noblemen, the assembly of the Church pretended that “<em>synagogues
of Satan had been erected upon the patrimony of the
Son of God</em>.” These same priests pleaded the examples of
Saint Ambrose and Saint Athanasius, who had refused
places of worship to the Arian heresy, in order to demand
the demolition of the new religious edifices. They insinuated
that the presentation of the list of grievances to the king,
proved the re-establishment of the political assemblies which
were forbidden by the edicts; that the collections made in
favour of the Vaudois of Piedmont, concealed a formidable
conspiracy, and might be followed by <em>warlike and dangerous
enterprises</em>; that the fortifications of some of the Huguenot
places had been reconstructed, and that the town of Montauban,
among others, was furnished with seventeen bastions.
They accused the “<em>apostates from the faith of their fathers</em>”
of aspiring to the most important dignities of the state; and
their harangue ended with a pathetic appeal to the protection
of the king; as if the (Roman) Catholic church of France
had been reduced to the last extremity!</p>

<p>We have analyzed the speech of the orator of the clergy
with some care, for it is from this moment that we must
date a fresh period of persecutions and cruelty, that lasted
until the Revocation [of the Edict of Nantes].</p>

<p>Mazarin did not accede to all that was demanded by the
priests; for the war with Spain still continued, and it was
still necessary to conciliate Cromwell. Nevertheless the
council published a declaration designed to explain that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
1652, and which in effect annulled it. Things were again
placed upon the same footing as in the time of Louis XIII.
The exercise of the (Reformed) religion was forbidden in the
places where it had been newly established; and to join, as it
would appear, chicanery to violence, several decrees prohibited
the ministers from taking the name of <em>pastors</em>, or of giving
that of <em>churches</em> to their flocks.</p>

<p>A more important interdiction, already issued in 1631,
was reproduced at this epoch, which went to deprive the
pastors of the right of preaching in the <em>quarters or annexed
districts</em>. To appreciate the extreme importance of the
question, which threatened to suppress more than half the
places of worship at one blow, it must be remembered that,
according to the Edicts, the services of the Reformed religion
could only be performed in a certain number of spots
that had been fixed, commune by commune, name by name,
within which it was lawful on the one hand, but criminal
on the other [to celebrate divine worship].</p>

<p>But many of these communes comprised flocks either too
small [in number] or too poor [in circumstances] to provide
for the maintenance of a pastor. The faithful in such cases
divided the burden by uniting, and one minister was charged
with the care of all. This was the origin of the <em>annexed
districts</em>.</p>

<p>It was not disputed that the right of preaching belonged to
the communes within their respective boundaries, or at least
it was not disputed directly; the letter of the Edicts had
pronounced [that they had the right]. But the pastors were
attacked. Had they the right of going beyond their place
of residence? Were they free to unite two or three distinct
flocks together? Called to one district, designated by name,
could they serve others with it? As far as justice and
common sense were concerned, there could have been no
question [on the matter]; but for the intolerance of the
priest, for the ill-will of the judge, for the hostile tendencies
of the council, there was a question, and good care was taken
not to let it drop.</p>

<p>This wretched quarrel for nearly forty years produced
vexations upon vexations, suits upon suits, appeals upon
appeals, the provincial synods commanding the pastors to
maintain themselves in the possession of their <em>annexed districts</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and the legal authorities forbidding them to do so
under pain of fines and imprisonment. For the most part,
the evidence of right had to give way to sophisms supported
by actual force.</p>

<p>The Parliaments of Toulouse, Rennes, Aix, and Poitiers,
made themselves remarkable by the rigour and iniquity of
their decrees. In every case of a Reformed and a (Roman)
Catholic, of a pastor and a priest, of a place of worship and a
church, of a consistory and an episcopal chapter, the heretical
party was wrong, unless it had tenfold reason on its side,
and its right was absolutely incontestable. These Parliaments
interpreted the Edicts in such a manner that scarcely
anything of them remained, and in criminal causes, the
slightest evidence was sufficient to condemn the Religionists
to excessive punishments.</p>

<p>How could the complaints of the Reformed reach the
court? They might no more hold political assemblies. The
council year after year refused the authority to hold a
national synod, and the voice of a single deputy-general, who
might be left to the churches, was disregarded. At length, in
1658, the provincial synods determined to send ten deputies
to Paris, commissioned to submit their grievances to the
king. Louis XIV. made them wait four months for an
audience, and when he condescended to receive them, he
said to them drily, “I will examine your statement, and will
do you justice.” Cardinal Mazarin was even more formal.
“The king will show by his acts,” he told the deputies, “the
good-will he bears towards you; be assured that I speak to
you sincerely.” Honeyed words, which were not believed!</p>

<p>All that the Reformers obtained, after the most persevering
solicitations, was a vague promise that the king would
observe the Edict of Nantes, “hoping that those of the pretended
Reformed religion <em>would render themselves worthy of this
favour</em>, by their good conduct, their fidelity, and their affection
in his service.” The reply betrayed injurious suspicions,
and the deputies did not conceal their chagrin. But the
court retracted nothing; it only announced that commissioners
from each religion should be sent into the provinces
to watch over the execution of the Edicts. These commissioners
entered upon their duties two or three years afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
and did the churches, as will be seen, much more harm
than good.</p>

<p>In 1659, peace having been concluded with Spain, Mazarin
conceded to the wishes of the Reformed so far as to grant
them permission to convoke a general synod. It was opened
at Loudun on the 10th of November, 1659, and was the last
of the national synods, at least of such as had the approval
of public authority.</p>

<p>One’s heart is filled with grief as the minutes of that
assembly are read. Nothing but haughtiness, threats, accusations,
and recrimination, appear on the side of the court;
whilst on the side of the Reformers, it is all humility, abasement,
and expression of gratitude,—gratitude for what?
Doubtless for the evil that had not yet been done them!</p>

<p>At the opening of the synod, the royal commissioner,
M. de la Magdelaine, addressed it, saying that the Reformed
had great reason to admire the benignity of his majesty, who
gave them the shelter of his royal authority.</p>

<p>He forbade them to make any complaint. “The king,”
he continued, “has commanded me to tell you that he has
much more reason to complain of the infractions and transgressions
of the Edicts committed by his subjects of the pretended
Reformed religion, and of the contempt they have
manifested for them, for they have reached the <em>supreme
degree of insolence</em>, even since his majesty has assumed the
reins of government, for they recommenced preaching in
Languedoc, in spite of its being prohibited, and not only in
that province, but everywhere else, which they have done
openly and boastingly.” It may be remarked that the same
grievances based upon the same acts, had already been produced
before the national synod of Charenton, fifteen years
before, which proves that the court had not found a single
new pretext for its reprimands.</p>

<p>The moderator of the assembly, Jean Daillé, thus answered
these reproaches, in a submissive tone of voice: “We receive
with all possible respect and humility, everything that is told
us on the part of his majesty.” Then he showed that so far
from having encroached upon the territory of the (Roman)
Catholic church, the Reformers had in many places beheld
their worship abolished and their places of worship razed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>The commissioner, acting upon the order of the court,
pressed the assembly to hasten the close of its sittings, and
gave them to understand that this would be the last of the
national synods: “His majesty,” said he, “having considered
that national synods cannot be holden unless at great expense
and without causing much inconvenience and trouble to
those who are deputed to [attend] them; and as, moreover,
many affairs and matters may be settled more easily and at
less cost in the provincial synods, the holding of which his
majesty permits once every year for the conservation of the
discipline of the pretended Reformed religion; for these
reasons, gentlemen, his majesty has judged expedient that I
should propose to you on his part to confer every power for
the future upon these provincial synods.”</p>

<p>To have talked of the expense of a few thousand horses
and the inconvenience of those who attended the national
synods, in order to colour the violation of the Edict of
Nantes, was a bitter mockery. Daillé answered, in the name
of the assembly, that he hoped the king would not deprive
them of his liberality. “Besides, the holding of these synods
being,” added he, “of absolute necessity to us, we will very
willingly bear all the expenses and all the inconveniences
that we have to undergo for such an object.” The assembly
then desired that “<em>with the good pleasure of his majesty</em>,” a
new synod should be held at Nismes, after an interval of
three years.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. did not grant that permission, and from the
10th of January, 1660, when the synod of Loudun terminated
its session, the presbyterian organization of the French
Reformation continued headless. Forcible state reasons had
arisen for suppressing political assemblies; none but the
most frivolous pretexts could be alleged for prohibiting the
convocation of the national synods. But with the maxims of
intolerance, the ruin of the former was certain to require the
destruction of the latter. Royalty had broken up the
Huguenot party, and the priesthood now made it crush the
religious community.</p>

<p>The first national synod was held in 1559; the nineteenth
and last met a century afterwards. If the Reformers
suffered in 1559, they had the hope of conquering the
kingdom. In 1659, they still suffered, but they had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
longer any hopes of this kind. Descartes had appeared, and
the field of the struggle against (Roman) Catholicism, at
least in France, had begun to change.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_X">X.</h3>
</div>


<p>Whilst the French Reformation was a prey to so many
harassing troubles, it gained honour before Europe and with
posterity, by the learning of its doctors. This was the great
epoch of its theology. Germany, so justly proud of its immense
labours in this branch of human knowledge, still cites
these theologians of the seventeenth century with respect.
The majority possessed, indeed, that solidity of judgment,
together with a profound and vast erudition, that clearness
of view, that skilful connection of proofs, in short, that precision
of style, which distinguish the good French writers in
every class of literature.</p>

<p>We shall only here name the most eminent of the doctors
or pastors of the Reformed churches. The history of their
ideas and their writings does not belong to our subject.</p>

<p>The academy of Montauban was at this time celebrated
for the orthodoxy of its doctrines, and the reputation of its
professors. Among them, may be mentioned Daniel Chamier,
Michel Bérault, and Antoine Garissoles.</p>

<p>Chamier had a genius for statesmanship, as well as for
the theological sciences. He had a great share in framing
the Edict of Nantes. The courtiers, who did not like him,
because he was proof against their seductions, ranked him
among the “<em>fools of the synod</em>.”</p>

<p>He held at Nismes, in 1600, a famous discussion with
Father Cotton, the confessor of Henry IV. Nothing could
be more opposite than the two antagonists. The one, a rigid
dialectician, went from syllogism to syllogism, straight to the
mark; the other abounded in rhetorical figures and brilliant
digressions. The Jesuit had the advantage of dazzling his
auditors, but the Reformed theologian had the gift of convincing
them, and victory remained with him.</p>

<p>The national synods invited him to refute the writings of
Bellarmine, which he did in a Latin work of four folio
volumes, entitled: <cite lang="fr">Panstratie Catholique, ou Ordre universel
de Bataille</cite>. He intended to publish a fifth volume upon the
question of the church, but was prevented by death. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
is the most complete controversial book of the French Reformation.
“Chamier,” says a modern German theologian,
“has profoundly penetrated into the examination of the
(Roman) Catholic doctrine. He attacks it with considerable
force and sagacity, seeking his proofs, by turns, from Scripture,
the Fathers, tradition, history, and philosophy. The
work is not prolix, in spite of its great length; it is singularly
full, rich and abundant.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Chamier was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of Montauban,
on Sunday, the 10th of October, 1621. He had
visited the ramparts to address some exhortations to the
soldiers, who had not been able to attend divine service.</p>

<p>His grandson, an advocate at Montélimart, was broken on
the wheel alive, in 1683, for having been present at a
religious assembly, which was called seditious, because it
defended itself against the dragoons of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Michel Bérault was a learned and skilful theologian, on
the testimony of Scaliger. He was chosen to dispute against
Duperron in the Conference of Nantes, and published, in
answer to the assertions of that bishop, a book upon the
“<cite>Vocation of the Ministers of the Gospel</cite>.” But his character
was more ardent than became a man of his cloth. The royal
commissioner demanded his exclusion from the national
synod of Charenton, because he had in his writings justified
the last resort to arms. Without obeying this injunction,
the assembly deemed it incumbent upon them to censure
Bérault before admitting him to take his seat.</p>

<p>Garissoles (born in 1587, died in 1650) had as much disinterestedness
as piety; and when the professors of Montauban
quitted their post, because the suppression of the royal pensions
prevented their payment, he alone continued to discharge
the duties of his office.</p>

<p>His book, <cite lang="fr">Imputation du Péché original</cite> (“The Imputation
of original Sin”), obtained a great success. The evangelical
cantons of Switzerland, to whom Garissoles had dedicated it,
rewarded him by the gift of four silver cups of splendid
workmanship, with a letter signed by the principal magistrates.
He also composed a Latin epic poem, <cite lang="la">L’Adolphide</cite>, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
which he celebrated the services that Gustavus Adolphus
had rendered to the Reformation.</p>

<p>The academy of Montauban subsisted in that town until
1661. It was then transferred elsewhere, and soon ruined,
for motives so puerile that they are almost beneath the
gravity of history.</p>

<p>The buildings of the theological college, having been
erected at the expense of the Reformed population, belonged
to them by the most legitimate title. Notwithstanding this,
the Jesuits, after the Edict of Grace, succeeded in procuring
an award to themselves of a part of it for their own lectures,
and not content with half, they sought means of invading
the rest, by ousting the real owners.</p>

<p>One day, therefore, they obstructed the court and principal
avenues of the edifice, on the occasion of a theatrical
piece appointed to be represented by their scholars. The
students of the Reformed communion arrived at the usual
hour, and found no passage or outlet by which they could
reach their lecture-rooms. The youths being irritated, grew
angry, and overturned the scaffoldings of the Jesuits, not
without some acts of violence, as may be conceived, between
the scholars of the two parties. Great complaints, denunciations,
and calumnies were immediately made to the court.
This foolish matter was transformed into a state-offence, and
a <i lang="fr">lettre de cachet</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> soon commended the delivery of the whole
college to the reverend Fathers.</p>

<p>The people of Montauban became displeased in their turn,
and crowded tumultuously round the door of one of their
places of worship where the Notables had assembled, at the
invitation of the consuls, to deliberate upon this affair. Fresh
denunciations, more exaggerated and blacker still than the
preceding [were uttered, asserting that] it was a vast plot:—the
signal of a general revolt of the heretics, of whom the
people of Montauban were the advanced guard. Mazarin
was then on his death-bed, and Louis XIV. was engaged
with his court <i lang="fr">fêtes</i>. The Jesuits had the direction of everything
with the queen-mother, Anne d’Autriche, who was
devoted to their cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>In short, for a few broken planks, and a little clamouring
at a popular meeting, Montauban was treated as a rebellious
city. Some thousands of soldiers were billeted upon the
townspeople. The remains of the walls were overthrown.
Several inhabitants were condemned to death, others were
banished, and the greater number ruined. Consuls of the
religion were no longer [permitted to reside in the town].
The academy was transferred to Puy-Laurens, where it only
vegetated; and Montauban, subjected to a government of
terror, was speedily depopulated. It was supposed that
Louis XIV. consented the more easily to this conduct of the
Jesuits, because he was glad [of an opportunity] to avenge
the affront which Louis XIII. had suffered before the ramparts
of Montauban, at the siege of 1620: he punished the
children for the heroic resistance of their fathers.</p>

<p>The academy of Saumur, founded by Mornay, had also a
high reputation. It was more open than that of Montauban
to the new ideas. Its professors, Cameron, Amyraut, Cappel,
and La Place, taught doctrines, which were a sort of compromise
or transition between Calvinism and Arminianism.</p>

<p>John Cameron (1579-1625), a Scotchman by birth, belonged
to French theology by his studies, his lectures, and
his writings. After having been pastor at Bordeaux, he
replaced Gomar in the chair of theology at Saumur, and also
brought there other opinions. He was a man of learning
and judgment, and well acquainted with philosophy; but he
was little versed in the study of the Fathers, and given to
attack, on all occasions, the books of Theodore de Bèze. He
spoke of many things in the received doctrines that required
correction; though his lectures, printed in 1626, do not
clearly indicate what changes he had in view.</p>

<p>He had, as we have said elsewhere, some differences with
the court, and sought refuge in England; but he was permitted
to return to the country of his adoption. The national
synod of Castres, granted a pension of seven hundred
livres to his children, “in testimony of the honour in which
his memory [was held].”</p>

<p>Moïse Amyraut (1596-1664), the most illustrious of the
disciples of Cameron, was accused before the national synod
of Alençon, of teaching opinions contrary to the confession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of faith. Numerous letters from Holland and Geneva taxed
him with a disguised plagiarism.</p>

<p>It is not our duty to relate these theological debates. It
may suffice to mention that the learned professor of Saumur
had enunciated a system, to which the name of <em>hypothetical
universalism</em> was given, by way of opposition to the doctrine
of the <em>particularists</em>. Amyraut taught that Jesus Christ’s
death was sufficient for all men, but that he died <em>efficaciously</em>
for the elect alone. He propounded also a <em>universal</em> predestination
in a certain sense; nevertheless, he defended
himself from the reproach of having adopted the principles
of the Arminians, and even published a profession of faith
against them.</p>

<p>The moderator of the synod, Benjamin Basnage, on hearing
his apology, offered him the hand of fellowship, as well
as to Testard, a pastor of Blois, who was accused of having
adopted the same sentiments. The dispute was nevertheless
renewed in the third synod of Charenton; but the assembly
imposed silence on both parties, and forbade any further
differences upon these questions, which it declared to be
useless for the work of salvation.</p>

<p>Amyraut was charged by the last national synod with the
compilation of the decisions concerning ecclesiastical discipline,
and received from that assembly the most honourable
marks of confidence. He had been long before reconciled to
most of his adversaries.</p>

<p>Nearly forty works of his are extant upon matters of
theology and edification. His paraphrases on the Bible
were much approved. His <cite lang="fr">Morale Chrétienne</cite>, dedicated to
M. Villarnoul, of the family of Duplessis-Mornay, is the
work of a man who had made himself thoroughly acquainted
with the Bible, the human heart, and the world. “My purpose,”
he says, “is to construct a code of Christian morality,
in which I may build, upon the foundations of nature, the
teachings which have been given us by Revelation.”</p>

<p>Amyraut did not simply possess the knowledge of the
theologian; he had a cultivated mind, a lively and engaging
conversation, agreeable manners, and a character which begot
universal good-will. The cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin
always showed him marks of great regard. He was exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
charitable, and during the last ten years of his life,
distributed the revenues of his appointment of pastor to the
poor of both communions.</p>

<p>His colleague, Louis Cappel (1585-1658), was one of the
first Hebraïsts of his age. He propounded a system upon
the use of the vowel-points in the original Hebrew, which
excited great opposition, and his <cite lang="fr">Critique Sacrée</cite>, published
after his death, still more increased the number of his
opponents, because he was accused of raising doubts upon the
universally received text of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Another colleague of Amyraut, Josué de la Place (1596-1655),
drew up a great portion of the <cite lang="fr">Thèses de Saumur</cite>,
which were an object of considerable attention in the theological
discussions of his times. He held peculiar opinions
upon the imputation of the sin of Adam. Man, according to
this doctor, while bearing the burden of original sin, is not
responsible for it before God, as if he had himself fallen in
the first transgression.</p>

<p>Etienne Gaussen, who died in 1675, filled the chair of
philosophy at Saumur. One of his books treats of the <em>use
of philosophy in theology</em>. There is also a judicious treatise
of his upon the <cite>Art of Professorship</cite>, and an interesting dissertation
upon the way to direct theological studies. His
works, written in Latin, have been well received in Germany
and Holland. A sixth edition was printed at Halle, in 1727,
and they have since been republished. Burmann, Franke,
Staeudlin, and other theologians, speak of him with much
commendation.</p>

<p>At the academy of Sedan, Pierre Dumoulin professed a
severe orthodoxy to his last day. He died at the age of
ninety years (1568-1658).</p>

<p>Dumoulin had been saved, when scarcely four years old, from
the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, through the devotion of
a servant. Nominated to a pastorship at Charenton, in
1599, he edified the faithful of Paris under the reign of
Henry IV. But the Jesuits took advantage of a letter that
he had written to the king of England, in 1621, to obtain a
warrant for his arrest, and he fled to Sedan, a town independent
of France at that time. His universally revered
character procured a joyful welcome for him. The national
synod of Castres in vain solicited Louis XIII. for his recall;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the Jesuits determinately opposed it. He had maintained a
sharp controversy against them, on the occasion of a sermon,
in which the Father Arnoux pretended that the confession of
faith of the Reformed, was in no way sanctioned by the
Scriptural texts indicated at the conclusion of the articles,
This accusation having attracted considerable attention,
Dumoulin, in concert with the pastors of Charenton, published
a <cite>Defence of the Reformed Churches of France</cite>. The
dedicatory epistle, addressed to Louis XIII., did not spare
the disciples of Loyola. “They cannot suffer,” said Dumoulin,
“a king, although Roman Catholic, if he be not a persecutor
of his subjects, and if he do not set fire to his kingdom.”</p>

<p>The Jesuits laid an information against the book, against
the author, against the printer, and even against the readers.
The sentence pronounced severe penalties against all who
should read the work, or have it in their houses.</p>

<p>Pierre Dumoulin laboured much during his long career.
We count no less than seventy-three works from his pen,
amongst which the most popular were <cite lang="fr">Le Boucher de la Foi</cite>,
<cite lang="fr">L’Anatomie de la Messe</cite>, and <cite lang="fr">Les Décades des Sermons</cite>. His
style of preaching was, at the same time, grave and familiar;
if he was deficient in classic elegance, he bore the impress of
a vigorous originality, which reveals the intimate life of the
preacher.</p>

<p>When his approaching death was announced to that venerable
pastor: “Oh! how good of you,” he exclaimed, “to
impart such news to me! Welcome, death, I rejoice at thy
coming! At length my aspirations will be fulfilled; I shall
be happy in the sight of my God!”</p>

<p>Another professor of Sedan, Louis Leblanc de Beaulieu,
(1615-1675), maintained the renown of that academy,
without entertaining doctrines so strictly Calvinist as those
of Dumoulin. His mind, to use the expression of his adversary
Nicole, was extraordinarily clear and well adapted for
unravelling complicated questions.</p>

<p>Leblanc endeavoured, not to unite the two communions,
but to approximate them to each other, by demonstrating
that many of their differences only rose upon verbal disputes.
He also tried to establish a solid peace between the Calvinists,
the Arminians, and the Lutherans. These efforts brought
upon him the charge of latitudinarianism. Pious men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
nevertheless, did full justice to the sincerity of his convictions
and to the rectitude of his character, and the severe Jurieu
defended him after his death against inconsiderate attacks.</p>

<p>His knowledge and his modesty were equally great. The
collection of his <cite lang="fr">Thèses</cite> forms an almost complete treatise of
dogmatic science: four editions were published in the course
of a few years.</p>

<p>Without being so celebrated as the others, the academy of
Nismes reckoned several meritorious professors. We have
already cited Samuel Petit (1594-1643), who was appointed
in 1627 to the three chairs of Theology, Greek, and Hebrew,
at the same time.</p>

<p>Petit had a profound acquaintance with the Oriental languages.
Having one day entered the synagogue of Avignon,
he heard the Rabbi pronounce in Hebrew injurious expressions
against Christians. The learned professor immediately
answered him in the same tongue, and without expressing
the least resentment, exhorted the Jewish doctor to become
better acquainted with the faith he attacked. The disconcerted
Rabbi apologised.</p>

<p>A cardinal had conceived so much esteem for Samuel Petit,
that he offered to throw open the doors of the library of the
Vatican to him, and to procure for him the appointment of
revising the manuscripts. The professor refused. He might
have found learning in the archives of Rome; but he would
have lost what he esteemed still more—liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>Petit has left divers works upon chronology and philosophy.
He also laboured to elucidate the antiquities of the Old and
New Testament. His character was kind, and he was more
bent upon doing good, than upon raising questions of controversy.</p>

</div>


<p>Beside the professors of the universities, the French
Reformation owned, in the seventeenth century, learned and
hard-working pastors, who equally claim a short notice.</p>

<p>André Rivet (1572-1651) exercised the pastoral functions
in France to the age of forty-seven, presided over the
national synod of Vitré, in 1617, and was then a professor
of theology in Holland. His <cite>Introduction to the Study of
the Bible</cite> lays down the true basis of sacred criticism. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
author insists that we must seek, not an allegorical or convenient
sense in the Scriptures, but the exact and real sense—that
which results naturally from the terms of the original
text.</p>

<p>Rivet was extremely severe in his doctrines, and sometimes
violent in his polemics; but he preserved a constant moderation
in his private life. “Adverse events, whether public
or otherwise,” says the author of his <cite>Last Hours</cite>, never surprised
him, or disturbed his serenity. He was accustomed
to say: “<em>Everything is possible; I wonder at nothing</em>.”
Thus he never burst into laughter; for he looked upon all
mundane things as mutable and transitory.</p>

<p>Edme Aubertin (1595-1652) had particularly studied the
Fathers. He published a book in 1633, upon the <cite>Eucharist
of the Ancient Church</cite>, in which he sought to prove that the
doctrine of the Real Presence was unknown during the first
six centuries of the Christian era. This work was denounced
to the privy council; but it was more easy to condemn
than to refute it. “That great and incomparable work
<cite lang="fr">L’Eucharistie</cite>” says the son of Jean Daillé, “has outlived
all the attacks of the other communion, no one of whom has
ventured into open war with it, or, so to speak, dared to meet
it <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>” (face to face).</p>

<p>In his last moments, the door of his apartment was forced
by the curate of Saint Sulpice, escorted by a commissary of
police and the mob. Edme <ins class="corr" id="tn-285" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Auberton awakened'">
Aubertin awakened</ins> by the tumult, and gathering his presence of mind, declared with a
firm voice that he died in the Reformed faith.</p>

<p>Benjamin Basnage (1580-1652) was commissioned, both
by the political assemblies and the national synods, with
missions as important as they were delicate. The court, which
feared his credit, would have prevented him from taking his
place at the national synod of Charenton in 1630. He has
written, besides several controversial treatises, an approved
work upon the <cite>Visible and Invisible State of the Church</cite>. We
shall have to speak in the following book of his illustrious
grandson, Jacques Basnage.</p>

<p>David Blondel (1591-1655) was more conversant with
ecclesiastical history than any other man of his time. Prodigies
are related of his memory: he had read everything,
and had forgotten nothing. Having become blind, he dictated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
two volumes in folio upon difficult points of chronology
and antiquity. The national synods conferred the title of
honorary professor upon him, without attaching him to any
academy, and all the provinces subscribed an annual pension
for his maintenance at Paris.</p>

<p>Blondel combatted the pretension of the Roman See to
the primacy, the false Decretals, and the Sybilline oracles.
His good faith equalled his erudition; he was blamed by
some of the older Huguenots for having contradicted the
legend of Pope Joan, to which they clung with great
prejudice.</p>

<p>Samuel Bochart (1599-1667) was a pastor at Caen, and
enjoyed there the respect of all the people of worth. “He
was,” says Bayle, “one of the most learned men the world
has seen. But his knowledge, however vast it might be, was
not his principal quality; his modesty is infinitely more to
be esteemed than all his learning. Hence the ease with
which he has worn his glory.”</p>

<p>Bochart has won an imperishable name by his <cite>Phaleg</cite>, the
<cite>Canaan</cite>, and the <cite>Hierozoïcon</cite>—three works which treat, one
of the dispersion of the primitive tribes, the two others of
the topography, and of the animals mentioned in the Bible.
They are still standard books upon these subjects. The German
doctor Michaëlis, who followed a century after, profited
considerably by the labours of Bochart, and the <cite>Hierozoïcon</cite>
was reprinted, in 1793, by Professor Rosenmüller.</p>

<p>Nearly all the pastors of Charenton or of Paris (for they
resided at the last city) were learned theologians, as well as
distinguished preachers.</p>

<p>Michel Le Faucheur, who died in 1657, has left some
volumes of sermons, which still deserve our study. We owe
to him also a treatise on the <cite>Action of the Orator</cite>, which was
attributed to Conrart, secretary to the French academy.
The second national synod of Charenton returned express
thanks to Le Faucheur for his reply to Cardinal Duperron,
concerning the doctrine of the Eucharist, and had it printed
at the cost of the churches.</p>

<p>Jean Mestrezat (1592-1657) was but eighteen years old
when he was offered a professorship of philosophy: he had
scarcely completed his theological studies, when he was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
pastor at Charenton—a remarkable distinction which
was awarded to no one else.</p>

<p>He defeated a Jesuit before the regent Anne d’Autriche,
and the princess was so astonished and dismayed by the force
of his arguments, that she ordered that the report of this
disputation should not be printed.</p>

<p>In an audience he had with Louis XIII., Cardinal de
Richelieu asked him, among other things, why the Reformed
called foreigners to their ministry? “It is to be wished,”
replied Mestrezat, “that so many Italian monks, who are in
France had the same zeal for his majesty as these stranger
pastors, who recognize no other sovereign than the king.”
At these words Cardinal de Richelieu exclaimed, tapping
him on the shoulder: “This is the boldest minister in all
France.”</p>

<p>The treatises of Mestrezat upon the Scriptures and upon
the Church, show him to have been one of the most skilful
doctors of the Reformed. His sermons, which may be always
read with advantage, are above all remarkable for their
correctness and depth of reasoning.</p>

<p>Charles Drelincourt (1595-1669) was the model of a true
pastor. He lived a life of faith and prayer, of charity and
devotion, employing the day in visiting his flock, and his
evenings in meditation and composition. On the 27th of
October, 1669, he was still preaching in the places of worship
at Charenton—the following Sunday he had ceased to live.
To him might be applied the words which he has put into
the mouth of a pastor at the end of his <cite lang="fr">Visites Charitables</cite>:
“I have long lived; I have long preached; I am not weary
of serving so good a Master, so liberal a Lord.”</p>

<p>The contemporaries of Drelincourt agree in saying that
no other minister at Charenton knew better how to lead the
erring back, to strengthen the weak, to exhort the lukewarm,
to comfort the poor, and to console the unhappy.</p>

<p>His works of edification and polemics have a popular
character, which made them welcome to every house in his
age, and has prolonged the life of some of them even till
now. It has been already seen that no adversary was more
dreaded by the converters than he, and that he had armed
in the most solid manner the simple and the illiterate against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
their sophisms by his <cite lang="fr">Abrégé des Controverses</cite>. The other
works of Drelincourt, which have been most frequently reprinted,
are his <cite lang="fr">Préparation à la Sainte Cène</cite>, his <cite lang="fr">Visites
Charitables</cite>, and his <cite lang="fr">Consolations contre la Mort</cite>. This last
book has been translated into all the languages of Europe,
and has been reproduced in more than fifty editions.</p>

<p>Drelincourt addressed these consolations to himself: “I
pray God,” said one of his friends to him in his last illness,
“that He may change your bed of infirmity into a bed of
health.” “My bed of health and of rest,” he answered,
“will be in heaven.”</p>

<p>Jean Daillé (1595-1670), of the same age as Drelincourt,
was long his colleague at Paris, and followed him quickly to
the grave. Prudent and reserved as well as pious, he acquired
general esteem, without ever swerving in his convictions
or his duties.</p>

<p>Educated from an early age, in the house of Duplessis-Mornay,
and having afterwards travelled through the principal
European states, he quickly displayed a mature intelligence.
Daillé’s first essay in authorship, was a master-piece,
<cite lang="fr">L Usage des Pères</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He ascribes to these venerable doctors
all that they are entitled to, without surrendering the
sovereign authority which he accords to the Bible in anything.
His <cite lang="fr">Apologie des Eglises Réformées</cite> is (also) firm
without being offensive. Truth is apparent throughout,
[combined] with charity. The author’s purpose was to
answer those who accused the Reformed of having sundered
Catholic unity, and while he acknowledged that division is a
great evil, he proves there are cases where it is the first of
duties.</p>

<p>The biographer of Jean Daillé has (many) interesting
details of his mode of life and study. “His books and his
studies,” says he, “constituted his chief recreation and delight.
They afforded him recreation from his work, and at the same
time pleasure and profit; and it was in them that he sought
rest after the wearisome occupations of the day. His industry
was very great; and as he rose early, he gained five
or six clear hours. It is not astonishing, therefore, that he
found leisure to produce so much, for he was a man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
profited by everything, and who never read a book, however
contemptible it might be, without making extracts from it,
which he well knew how to use at the proper time and
place.”</p>

<p>About the year 1660, some younger pastors of no less
merit began to appear, such as Dubosc, Larroque, Ancillon,
and Claude.</p>

<p>Pierre Dubosc, born at Bayeux, in 1623, has been pronounced
as the greatest preacher of the Reformed in the
seventeenth century. “It may be said without flattery,” writes
Elie Benoit, “that he had all the gifts necessary to constitute
a Christian preacher. He had a mind enlightened by
the knowledge of literature. He was a good philosopher, a
sound theologian, and a judicious critic. His personal appearance
also was favourable; his voice was both powerful
and sweet, and his action pleasing.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The church of Charenton made many urgent requests, in
1658, to draw him to Paris. Marshal Turenne, the Marquis
de la Force, and other illustrious persons, joined their solicitations
[for this purpose]. But Dubosc refused to leave the
church of Caen, his maxim being, that a minister cannot quit
his flock with a good conscience, until he has obtained their
express consent.</p>

<p>When this appeal was renewed in 1670, the archbishop
of Paris went so far as to implore the king three times in
the same week, to prevent the nomination of Dubosc, as if
he dared not trust the cause of (Roman) Catholicism to the
eloquence of Bourdaloue and Bossuet.</p>

<p>The Jesuits of Normandy, jealous of his fame, accused
Dubosc of having spoken of confession in derogatory terms,
and procured his banishment to Châlons in 1664. He did
not remain there many months, thanks to the good offices of
some powerful protectors.</p>

<p>Dubosc was often deputed by the oppressed churches to
Louis XIV. He was commissioned in 1668 to seek from
him the maintenance of the edicts. On first hearing him,
Louis was inattentive and absorbed with other thoughts.
But gradually he listened, and evinced signs of satisfaction.
The demeanour, the voice, the grave, yet easy air, the eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
words of the orator completely triumphed over the
repugnance with which Louis had been inspired against
all the heretic ministers. “Madam,” he said to the queen
after the audience, “I have just heard the best speaker
in my kingdom.” And turning to his courtiers [he added],
“It is certain that I have never heard any one speak so
well.”</p>

<p>Pierre Dubosc was banished by the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, and died in a land of exile in 1692.</p>

<p>Matthieu de Larroque (1619-1684) had the happiness of
closing his eyes amidst his flock, on the eve of his sentence
of banishment. He had also been called by the church of
Charenton in 1669, but the king forbade the prosecution of
the summons, notwithstanding the representations of the
general deputy Ruvigny. Other churches, Vitré, Saumur,
Montauban, and Bordeaux, disputed the privilege of possessing
a man of so much merit and learning. Larroque wrote
a <cite>History of the Eucharist</cite>, which disturbed the imaginary
triumph of the controversialists of Port Royal on this
subject.</p>

<p>David Ancillon (1617-1692) possessed great theological
knowledge; unhappily, he has written but little. Called, in
the first instance, to minister to the church of Meaux, he
won universal good-will. “What gained him the affection
of all,” says his son, “were his life without reproach and his
deep and simple piety. The humblest of his friends were
always sure of his exertions in their behalf; and while his
good offices were open to all, no difference of religion made
any [change] in his behaviour to any one. He softened and
tamed the Roman ecclesiastics of the diocese, and lived upon
friendly terms with them; by which means he preserved peace
and concord among all the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>His preaching appears to have possessed singular attraction.
He meditated and composed his sermons with great
care, although he published but one—<cite>The Tears of Saint Paul</cite>.
Ancillon was in the habit of saying, “that it was showing
too little esteem for the public, to take no pains in preparation,
and that a man, who should appear on a ceremonial
day in his night-cap and dressing-gown, would not commit a
greater breach of civility.”</p>

<p>He was a pastor at Metz at the time of the Revocation;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
and when he embarked, with his three colleagues, in the
vessel which was to bear him from his native land, all the
faithful assembled on the shore, and watched his departure
with tears and sobs. Many followed him into exile. David
Ancillon met with a favourable reception at Berlin from the
elector of Brandenburg, and became the head of the illustrious
family which has done so much honour to the French
name in Germany.</p>

<p>Jean Claude, the last of the eminent pastors of Charenton,
was born in 1619, at La Salvetat, in Rouergue. Claude was
a pious man, a learned theologian, a skilful preacher, a wise
and cautious writer, and being, moreover, endowed with a
judgment and presence of mind that never failed, he was
more capable than any one of opposing the champions of the
(Roman) Catholic church; and without pretending that his
genius was equal to that of Bossuet, it may be doubted
whether he has not excelled him in soundness of learning
and force of reasoning.</p>

<p>His name will reappear more than once in the course of
this history. After exercising the pastoral function in Languedoc,
where he displayed considerable energy, he was
called to Charenton in 1666. He there took the first place
after the death of Drelincourt and Daillé, without contest.
“M. Claude,” says his biographer, Ladevèze, “particularly
shone as president of an assembly. He appeared in this
position for several years in the Consistory of Charenton; as
well as in more than one synod of the Isle of France, where
he was moderator. However complicated might be the
matters submitted to the synod, and however disguised by
ignorance or party manœuvres, M. Claude had so exact a
spirit of discernment, that he unravelled all this chaos in a
moment.”</p>

<p>It would be easy to extend the list of doctors and pastors,
who have acquired a name in the French Reformation during
the seventeenth century. They generally preceded the great
defenders of the (Roman) Catholic communion,—Arnauld,
Nicole, Bossuet,—and in a degree, compelled their appearance.
Why were such flourishing studies arrested by persecution?
Why were men, who bore with so firm a hand the glorious
burden of Calvin and Theodore de Bèze, driven to waste
their pens upon their miserably dispersed places of worship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
and academies? This was indeed a disgrace to the Church
of Rome and a misfortune for France.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_XII">XII.</h3>
</div>


<p>We now resume the chain of events, of which the picture
will be both sad and sorrowful. We will soften the outlines,
but not efface them; for we are writing history. We may
collect the lesson, that intolerance stands upon a slippery
precipice, from which, the moment she has made a slip, she
is dragged from iniquity to iniquity, and from violence to
violence, until she reaches the most atrocious excesses—a
moral which perhaps is not absolutely useless, even at this
day.</p>

<p>Mazarin died in 1661; his death was a loss to the Reformed.
Although he inspired them with little confidence,
and was not friendly to them, this cardinal preferred the use
of stratagem to that of force; and as he sought to support
his foreign policy by the Protestant power, he dared not impose
too hard a yoke upon the French Calvinists.</p>

<p>After his decease, Louis XIV. resolved to govern alone,
and persecution increased. Not that this prince was naturally
cruel; had he been so, he would have restrained himself
out of respect for his own greatness; but he had been
educated in hatred of the Huguenots. Other motives, which
we shall explain, intervened later to strengthen the prejudices
of his childhood, and the obliteration of heresy was
one of the fixed ideas of his reign. He may have varied as
to the means, have faltered between the course of persuasion
and that of persecution, have even seemed to retrace his
steps, and to defer until more favourable opportunities the
execution of this great undertaking; but through all these
fluctuations and adjournments, his object never changed.</p>

<p>In 1661 commissioners were nominated in each province
to examine into the real or pretended violation of the Edict
of Nantes, and to re-establish peace between the two communions.
One of these commissioners was a (Roman) Catholic,
the other a Calvinist. This measure would have been
excellent, if the agents for carrying it out had enjoyed the
same rights, and the authority whose duty it was to decide
ultimately, had been impartial between them. It was however
quite otherwise, and that which was intended as a guarantee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
to the Reformed, became a fresh source of troubles
and iniquities.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic commissioner appointed to each
general district, was generally a man of consideration, holding
a seat in Parliament, or even in the king’s council, and was
known for his entire devotion to the interests of the Romish
church. The Calvinist commissioner, on the contrary, with
very rare exceptions, was either some poor gentleman ignorant
of business, or some ambitious individual secretly sold to the
court, and nominated by the intendants, sometimes even by
the bishops, expressly to betray his duty. The first had all
the power that accompanies a state religion; the second, all
the weakness of a religion scarcely tolerated. One spoke
with authority, invoking the name of the king; the other
spoke with humility, in the name of the poor oppressed,
whose fears he shared.</p>

<p>The commissioners were instructed to ascertain the rights
of exercising worship in the contested districts. But as
many churches had no authentic titles, either because they
had never supposed that these documents would become
necessary, or because they had been lost during the religious
wars, they could only maintain their right by actual possession
and traditional notoriety. Constant quibbling was the
consequence of this—in order to defeat the claims of the
churches. The syndics of the (Roman) Catholic clergy were
admitted to interfere in these disputes, and sought to invade
everything; and when there was any disagreement between
the two commissioners, the matter was decided by the
council, whose aim was to restrict the Huguenots to the
narrowest limits; or by the intendants, who had no other
object than that of paying their court to Louis XIV.</p>

<p>It is impossible to count in how many districts the exercise
of the Reformed religion was interdicted, how many
places of worship were razed, schools suppressed, charitable
establishments confiscated for the benefit of the (Roman)
Catholics, and how many individuals also experienced crying
injustice, however incontestable might be their rights. This
would fill volumes.</p>

<p>Some Jesuits and others published lengthy writings, in
which, under pretence of interpreting the Edict of Nantes,
they demolished it piecemeal. The more skilful they showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
themselves in the invention of new sophisms against the
execution of the law, the more they thought they deserved
from their church. The priest Soulier, author of an <cite>Explanation
of the Edict of Nantes</cite>, unintentionally confesses this
in his dedicatory epistle to the bishops: “I shall esteem
myself too fortunate, sirs,” says he, “if I can second the
zeal of your daily labours, after the example of the greatest
of kings, for the extinction of heresy.” The explanation was
at all events designed, right or wrong, to extinguish heresy.</p>

<p>These writings were sent to the council, to the parliaments,
to the procurators-general, and the intendants, who,
without approving the whole of their contents, furnished
themselves with weapons out of these great arsenals of the
Jesuit school, and never failed to use them when they could
do so with any decency.</p>

<p>In 1663 the clergy obtained, at the instance of their
General Assembly, a declaration against those who <em>relapsed</em>,
that is to say, against those who returned to the Reformed
communion, after having abjured. “These people could no
longer pretend,” the preamble stated, “to the benefit of the
Edict of Nantes, since they had renounced, and by returning
to the heresy, had incurred the guilt of the enormous crime
of profanation against the sacred mysteries of the (Roman)
Catholic religion.” The ordinance consequently pronounced
against them the penalty of perpetual banishment. This
declaration is regarded by Rulhières, and other historians, as
the first direct attack upon the Edict of Nantes, and the first
decisive step in the path of revocation.</p>

<p>There were at that time a certain number of individuals,
who went from the Reformed to the (Roman) Catholic communion,
without well knowing why, and without any serious
intention of remaining. Some gave way to threats, others
to momentary seductions, others to weakness, or the natural
inconstancy of their minds. It was, in the first place, a
great error, to admit them so lightly into the Church of
Rome, and some Jansenist bishops, more scrupulous than the
others, complained of it. It was a still greater error to seek
to retain them there by terror.</p>

<p>But the clergy went farther; they set themselves to invent,
and to create backsliders. Attendance at mass for three or
four Sundays, the blessing of a priest in a mixed marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
a confidential avowal to a (Roman) Catholic of a leaning
towards his religion, a conjecture, an appearance, a hearsay,
or some mention of abjuring fifteen or twenty years before—all
these were transformed into acts of (Roman) Catholicism,
and if the pretended convert placed foot again within
a heretic place of worship, he was dragged before the tribunals
as a relapsed person.</p>

<p>So many abuses, and such grave troubles resulted from this,
that a new declaration, published in 1664, decreed the nullity
of all the procedures begun upon the subject. Yet the
law was only suspended; and it was afterwards resumed
with the addition of cruel aggravations.</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1665, an ordinance of the council
authorized the curates, and all the ecclesiastics of the Romish
church generally, to present themselves with a magistrate at
the domicile of sick persons, to ask if they were willing to
die in their heresy, or to be converted to the true religion.
It is easy to imagine the double scenes of grief and scandal
that would ensue, whenever the priest was a fanatic and the
magistrate compliant. It was no longer possible to live or to
die in peace, out of the Roman communion.</p>

<p>Paternal authority was also destined to be severely attacked.
Without speaking of the crimes of abduction that
were committed in many places, frequently with the most
complete impunity, children were declared, by a decree of
the 24th of October, 1665, to be capable of embracing
(Roman) Catholicism; boys at fourteen years of age, girls
at twelve, and parents were under the obligation of providing
them with an alimentary allowance to maintain them out of
their houses.</p>

<p>The Reformed complained bitterly of this law, and what
was more strange, the bishops and commissioners-general of
the clergy complained of it also. They told the chancellor
that their conscience did not permit them to allow so much
power to the hands of heretic fathers, and that children,
being responsible for their acts before the age of fourteen or
of twelve years, it ought to be permitted to receive them
into the true church as soon as they desired it. The chancellor
discussed the matter with them for form’s sake; and
at the conclusion of the audience said to them: “The king
has done his duty, you will do yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>The abjurations of many children were in fact received
before the specified age; and when the parents had recourse
to legal proceedings, the advocates-general decided that there
was a great difference between exciting by “inducing”
children to change religion, and receiving them with open
arms, when they presented themselves by a sort of inspiration
from heaven. Some years after, a new law, of which
we shall speak, sanctioned these attacks against the most
sacred rights of families.</p>

<p>The ordinances against blasphemers, and in particular
against those accused of outraging the honour, the purity, and
the holiness of the Virgin Mary, were confirmed. This gave
rise to a host of prosecutions as extravagant as they were barbarous.</p>

<p>The sermons of the pastors were collected by spies in the
pay of the Jesuits, and if there were found any terms, however
slight, against the teachings of (Roman) Catholicism, these
pastors were cited before the tribunals under the accusation
of blasphemy. Many individuals were exposed to
the same treatment, and (Roman) Catholics who were at
law with the Reformed, were often found to tax them with
some blasphemy, for the purpose of gaining an undue advantage
over the adverse party.</p>

<p>It daily became more difficult for the Reformed to obtain
admission to public offices. They had been at first kept out
of high employments; access to the less important places
was next closed, and by degrees they were debarred from the
very smallest, unless in the towns and cantons where they
still retained the majority. In many provinces, a profession
of the (Roman) Catholic faith was exacted from simple artisans
before they could obtain a license to pursue their
calling.</p>

<p>Even the corporation of laundresses at Paris laid a remonstrance
before the council, that their community having been
instituted by Saint Louis, could not admit heretics, and this
reclamation was gravely confirmed (singular monument of
folly!) by a decree of the 21st of August, 1665. It was
thereupon remarked that these washerwomen had in their
corporation many abandoned women, of whom they did not
complain, and that they disturbed themselves much more about
heresy than about evil manners. The example had been set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
them, it is true, by the priests, by the court, and particularly
by Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Colbert, however, persisted in employing the Reformed in
financial employments. A Protestant from Germany, Bartholomew
Herward, had been appointed intendant of the
finances under the ministry of Mazarin, notwithstanding the
opposition of the commissioners of the clergy, authentically
signified to the chancellor. Herward next became comptroller-general.
“He favoured those of his religion,” says
Elie Benoit; “the finances became the refuge of the Reformed,
to whom all other employments were refused. They entered
into the farms and commissions, and made themselves so
necessary in affairs of this nature, that even Fouquet and
Colbert could not dispense with them, and were forced to
retain them as people of proved fidelity, and of acknowledged
capacity.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Colbert, in fact, relied upon their spirit of order, economy,
and probity, and cared very little about their religion, provided
the people in his service were but honest. Rulhières has a
curious remark upon this subject in his <cite lang="fr">Eclaircissements
historiques</cite>: “The fact is, that the financiers then enjoyed
general esteem for the first time; they were not attacked
either by Molière, Lafontaine, or Boileau. This silence of
the satirists about the financiers, during the period, in which
the greatest number of these offices were filled by Protestants,”
Rulhières adds, “is it not infinitely honourable to
them?”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Others of them being excluded from offices of state, and
even of the municipal magistracy, had betaken themselves to
arts and manufactures, agriculture and industry, a new title
of recommendation to the protection of Colbert. But this
great minister of state soon succumbed before the will of his
master, for under Louis XIV. genius did not relieve any one
from the duty of being a courtier.</p>

<p>Together with the violence of the council and of the tribunals,
the Reformed had to endure those puerile vexations
and petty annoyances from which intolerance can never free
itself. They were prohibited, among other things, from
singing psalms either on land or water, in their workshops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
or at their house-doors. If a procession happened to pass
while they were singing in their places of worship, they had
to stop. Their burials could take place only at break of
day, or at nightfall, and not more than ten persons were permitted
to participate in the funeral, except at Castres, Montauban,
Nismes, and in towns of the same order, where the
presence of thirty persons was authorized. It was not lawful
for the Reformed to marry unless at the times fixed by
the canons of the (Roman) Catholic church; and the nuptial
procession might not exceed, parents included, the number
of twelve persons.</p>

<p>The rich churches were interdicted from contributing to
the support of ministers for the poor churches. It was considered
a crime in the consistories to pronounce censures
against those, who placed their children in the colleges of the
Jesuits. The pastors lost the right of taking the title of
doctors of theology, and the king forbade them, under
penalty of a fine of three hundred livres, to wear the cassock
and long robe elsewhere than in their places of worship.
They might speak and pray in the hospitals only in whispers,
lest they should offend the ears of the (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, the bishop of Uzès, the orator of
the general assembly of the clergy, declared to the king, in
1665, that “it behoved him to labour with greater ardour
<em>for the entire extirpation</em> (such were his words) <em>of the redoubtable
monster of heresy</em>.” He asked, besides, that liberty of
conscience should be taken away from the (Roman) Catholics,
that is to say, that it should be no longer permissible for
them to leave the Roman church, adding that twenty-two
dioceses of Languedoc had demanded this from the provincial
estates, and that all the dioceses of the kingdom were
ready to seal that declaration with their blood.</p>

<p>The council could not yet proceed to extremities, [and]
refused [to do so]. But in the following year it passed a
most comprehensive act, by sanctioning, under the form of a
general law, all the decrees that had been made upon particular
cases by the courts of justice. The preamble stated
that this law had been accorded on the demand of the
assembly of the clergy. It comprised fifty-nine articles,
which all tended to restrict the liberties that the Edict of
Nantes had declared perpetual and irrevocable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>The first emigration dates from this epoch. The Reformed
hoped no longer to meet with either justice or repose in
their native land, and preferred the sufferings of exile to
those of persecution.</p>

<p>The Protestant powers of Europe began to be moved.
The elector of Brandenburg, one of the most faithful and
useful allies of Louis XIV., wrote to him in favour of the
Reformed. The king replied that he permitted them to
live on an equality with his other subjects. “I am bound
to do so,” said he, “by my royal word, and by the gratitude
I feel for the proofs they have given of their fidelity during
the late disturbances (of the Fronde), in which they bore
arms in my service.”</p>

<p>These were but diplomatic phrases, that deceived no one.
England and Sweden, whose neutrality was necessary to
Louis XIV. after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, expressed
also their solicitude for the fate of the Reformed of France.
Emigration continued; and all these circumstances induced
the council to publish, in 1669, a kind of retractation of the
preceding decrees. Nine articles of the declaration of 1666
were suppressed and twenty-one softened. Although this
was but half-justice, the poor oppressed people esteemed
themselves fortunate [in obtaining it].</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the celebrated edict was published,
which prohibited the king’s subjects, under pain of confiscation
of liberty and property, from going to establish themselves
in foreign countries without express permission, and
particularly from taking service in the quality of ship-builders
or sailors. This law struck all Frenchmen in
their ancient liberties; but it was enforced only against those
who emigrated on account of their religion.</p>

<p>The Marshal de Turenne had just abjured (1669). This
conversion had all the importance of a general act. Turenne
had resisted the invitations of Mazarin and Louis XIV., and
had not even been dazzled by the offer of the constable’s
sword. He changed all at once, when no one any longer
expected it, and why, has never been made known.</p>

<p>Some (Roman) Catholic writers say that he had become
enlightened by Bossuet’s <cite>Exposition of the Doctrines of the
Catholic Church</cite>,—a book, indeed, well arranged, soberly
penned, and of wonderful skill, in which the author hides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
the greatest errors of doctrine and practice of (Roman)
Catholicism under the artifices of deeply-studied diction. It
is possible that the old soldier did not investigate very
narrowly, and that his limited information upon controversial
questions might have failed to protect him against the
subtilties of the theologian.</p>

<p>The Reformed historians explain the matter otherwise.
They relate that Turenne, who was at all times lax in his
religion, had only been retained in it by his wife and his
sisters, Mesdames de Duras and de la Trémoille, both very
zealous for the Reformed belief. When he was left alone,
and had surrendered himself to gallantries little compatible
with the faith, he accepted the reasoning of Bossuet.</p>

<p>This is the place to observe that the greater part of the
court nobility,—the families of Bouillon, Châtillon, Rohan,
Sully, La Trémoille,—regulating themselves by the will of
the monarch, had one by one re-entered the (Roman) Catholic
church. Their licentious manners had also prepared them
for abjuration; these were not less inordinate than those of
the rest of the courtiers, according to the testimony of
Tallemant des Réaux, who was himself a Calvinist by birth.</p>

<p>Among the people of importance, who had remained faithful
to the Reformation, we may cite the Count de Schomberg,
who had been commander-in-chief of the armies; the Duke
de la Force and his house; a younger branch of the family
of La Rochefoucault; several descendants of Duplessis-Mornay;
the Marquises de Ruvigny, of whom one was minister-plenipotentiary
at London, and the other deputy-general of
the churches. The lesser nobility in the provinces had been
more firm than the great noblemen. Languedoc, Guienne,
Quercy, Saintonge, Poitou, Normandy, still reckoned thousands
of gentlemen devoted to the faith of their fathers, and
who, in return for the good services they rendered to the
king in his armies and his fleets, asked only for a little justice
and protection.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_XIII">XIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The abjuration of Turenne renewed the projects of reunion,
which had never been entirely abandoned since the attempt
of Cardinal de Richelieu. The Prince de Conti, governor of
Bas-Languedoc, desirous of making himself agreeable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
Louis XIV., had already renewed the endeavour in 1661.
The provincial synod of Nismes answered him, in the rude
language of the period, by the mouth of their moderator
Claude, that the Reformed would be guilty of unpardonable
cowardice if they consented to “<em>unite light with darkness,
Christ with Belial</em>.”</p>

<p>The project assumed a more serious turn from 1670 to
1673. The Marshal de Turenne took it up with the approbation
of the king, and tried to obtain the adhesion of the
pastors. An agent of the court visited one after another
those who were dependent upon the national synod of Charenton;
and partly by threats of the king’s displeasure,
and partly by the promise of accomplishing the reunion upon
an equitable basis, this emissary succeeded in extorting from
several ministers the verbal or written promise of supporting
the plan in the next synodal assembly.</p>

<p>It was stated that the king was disposed to extirpate the
abuses in the Romish church, which most shocked the Reformed;
that the worship of images, purgatory, prayers for
the dead, the invocation of saints, would be either suppressed
or at least sensibly corrected; that theologians freely chosen
from both sides, would have the mission of contriving a mutual
understanding upon the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper; that
the use of the cup would be restored to the laity, and the
religious service would be celebrated in the vernacular;
finally, that if the pope sought to oppose these changes, the
king would go further, having the word of forty-two bishops
upon these articles, and knowing the means of bringing the
others to the same opinion.</p>

<p>This was evidently a falsehood. Louis XIV. could not
execute what the subaltern agents promised in his name;
and if the bishops had refused to make this concession at the
colloquy of Poissy, when the Reformation was widely extended
throughout the whole kingdom, how could one among
them have made such concessions to a small minority, shut up
in its places of worship, without political authority, shorn of
all power of religious expansion, and well-nigh extirpated?</p>

<p>Nor did the wisest of the Reformed fall into the snare;
for they knew that Rome uses two very different languages:
the first, when she wishes to gain over heretics; the second,
when she has them under her hoof. They knew, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
that the accord would, in the end, be limited to an entire
submission on their part, followed by a merciful pardon on
the other. For this reason, the provincial synod convoked at
Charenton, in the month of May, 1673, opposed the new
project of reunion with an energetic refusal, and the five
pastors, who had promised to support it, solemnly declared
their determination against it.</p>

<p>The same attempts produced the like results in Saintonge,
Languedoc, and the Vivarais. The court and the clergy at
length recognised that there was no rational hope of reducing
the Reformed in this direction, and were driven to seek other
means for the extermination of heresy.</p>

<p>Two methods, very different in their principle and line of
action, were indicated by the adversaries of the Huguenots.
The Jansenists, and the most enlightened and most pious of
the (Roman) Catholics generally, proposed to convert them
by persuasion, fair treatment, and good examples, thinking
that it was better to leave the erring without the pale of the
Church than to force hypocrites to enter it. The Jesuits and
their friends said, on the contrary, that it was incumbent to
use both the authority of the king and the Parliaments
without reserve, to exact acts of Catholicity at any price, and
then to retain folks by the fear of executions, upon the fundamental
maxim, that if the new (Roman) Catholics had little
faith, their children would have more, and their grandchildren
still more. The court balanced a long time between
these two systems, which serves to explain its alternatives of
mildness and rigour. But in the end, the advice of the
Jesuits prevailed.</p>

<p>Ordinances, declarations, decrees, and other acts of the
council followed, striking the heretics blow upon blow.
Their number was so great that it is impossible to indicate
even the substance of them. The Reformed were successively
forbidden to raise supplies for the maintenance of their
ministers, and the expense of sending them to the synods;
to except against suspected judges, although this right was
preserved to other Frenchmen; to print religious books
without the authorization of the magistrates of the Romish
communion; to suborn and corrupt, that is to say, to seek to
convert (Roman) Catholics, under pain of a fine of a thousand
livres; to celebrate their worship in the places and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
the days when the bishops made their tours; to have more
than one school and one master in each of the districts where
they exercised their religion; to teach by this master anything
else than writing, reading, and the elements of arithmetic;
and so on. The Reformed were oppressed in their
religious faith, their civil person, their political rights, their
domestic condition, the education of their children, and each iniquity
necessarily produced others. Thus evil ever begets evil.</p>

<p>Some pastors, having held unlawful meetings upon the
ruins of their places of worship, which had been unjustly
pulled down, were condemned to do penance with a rope
round their neck, and were then banished the kingdom.
The demolitions spread, and were multiplied for the most
trivial motives, upon the denunciations of a bishop, or of
some other member of the clergy, upon the quibbles of
a (Roman) Catholic commissioner, or simply, as the faithful
of Saint Hippolyte experienced, upon the accusation of
having manifested disrespect for a curate bearing the holy
sacrament along the street.</p>

<p>There were in Béarn ninety-six places of worship, and
forty-six churches of residence. A lawsuit, which lasted seven
years, reduced the number of places of worship to twenty, and
fettered these in every possible way. It was nearly the same
in all the provinces of the kingdom. If the council sometimes
used precaution, and imposed upon the intendants
some reserve, the pastor Claude presumes, in his <cite lang="fr">Plaintes des
Protestants de France</cite>, that it was to induce the belief that
justice was regarded, and that the condemned churches had
not good titles.</p>

<p>The mind feels some relief, amidst these persecutions, in
dwelling upon the paper wars which were fought at the
same epoch between the most eminent pastors of the two
religions. Here at least material violence did not intervene;
here the contest was equal; and when men of great powers
attacked the Reformation, it did not want solid and skilful
champions for its defence.</p>

<p>The Jansenists were so accustomed to the strife, that they
could not desist from it; and peace having been concluded
between them and the Jesuits, through the intermission of
Clement IX., they turned their arms against the Huguenots.
They imported into the conflict all the greater zeal, that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
were themselves taxed with being no more than disguised
Calvinists.</p>

<p>Arnault and Nicole therefore published their famous
<cite lang="fr">Perpétuité de la Foi sur l’Eucharistie</cite> (1664-1676), in which
they endeavoured to establish, from the text of the Fathers
of the Church, and by certificates brought from the East,
that the dogma of the real presence has been at all times
admitted in Christianity. Claude replied that they had
wrongly interpreted the sense of the Fathers, and certificates
procured from poor Greek popes by the ambassador of France,
who was their protector against the Turks, were but of little
value. His answer had extraordinary success; and the
Jesuits themselves did their best to disseminate it, as Arnault
complains in one of his letters, because they were quite as
much interested in humiliating the Jansenists as in destroying
the Reformed.</p>

<p>Nicole re-entered the lists with his <cite lang="fr">Préjugés légitimes contre
les Calvinistes</cite>. His argumentation was sadly wanting in
caution. He maintained that before quitting the Church of
Rome, the meanest artisan is bound to assure himself of the
authenticity of the holy writings, to compare the translations
with the original, to examine all the various readings, to
weigh all the interpretations of the texts, to compare them
with the decisions of the councils, to perform in a word an
immense labour that the most erudite dare hardly undertake.
These arguments, every one knows, have been turned by
Rousseau against (Roman) Catholicism and even against the
Gospel. Claude, Jurieu, and Pajon answered Nicole.</p>

<p>Arnault came to the succour of his friend in a book upon
the <cite lang="fr">Renversement de la Morale de Jesus Christ par les Erreurs
des Calvinistes</cite>. It astonished every one that a doctor who
agreed with Calvin upon the dogma of predestination, had
constructed all the scaffolding of his polemics upon this consequence,
that <em>grace cannot be lost</em>; and this was judiciously
objected to him, not only by Bruguier, pastor of Nismes, but
by theologians of his own communion.</p>

<p>Bossuet’s <cite lang="fr">Exposition</cite> also provoked numerous replies. La
Bastide, a member of the consistory of Charenton, and David
Noguier, a pastor of Languedoc, proved that this work was
wanting in truth, and that the author has constructed an
ideal Catholicism totally unlike the real. Pierre Jurieu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
proved it better than any one in his <cite lang="fr">Preservatif contre le
Changement de Religion</cite>, and resumed the same question in his
<cite lang="fr">Politique du Clergé de France</cite>. “Here is a man,” he says,
“who transports us into another country. There is no worship
of images, no invocation of saints in this new religion;
they are only implored just as we beg the faithful on earth
to pray to God for us. Until now, I had thought that the
devotions to the Virgin and to the other saints was an important
thing; I see that the majority of devotees think
them of great consequence; and these people say they are
nothing, they may be dispensed with, and that it is sufficient
to invoke God and Jesus Christ!”</p>

<p>Claude had a celebrated conference with Bossuet in 1678,
upon the invitation of Mademoiselle de Duras. The two
adversaries have published the report of their debate. Bossuet
had pledged himself to make Claude avow that it may
happen that a simple individual, however ignorant he may
be, understands the Scriptures better than all the councils
and all the rest of the Church together—a proposition which
he styled as absurd. Claude answered that the question was
not so simple, and that before asking if an artisan may be
right in spite of all the councils and the Church, it should be
shown that there is a single article, upon which the Church
and all the councils have constantly agreed.</p>

<p>Ten years afterwards, the bishop of Meaux (Bossuet)
re-entered the arena with his <cite lang="fr">Histoire des Variations des
Eglises Protestantes</cite>. His attacks were made upon the
absentees and the proscribed, whose books of refutation were
not permitted to pass from Holland into France.</p>

<p>To speak alone was a privilege a man like Bossuet ought
to have repudiated.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_XIV">XIV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The jubilee of the year 1676 brought about what certain
historians call the <em>conversion</em> of Louis XIV. This prince
experienced deep remorse that he had caused so much scandal
at court and in his kingdom by his public adulteries.
He resolved, so he promised his spiritual directors, not to
revisit Mademoiselle de Montespan. But he had not the
firmness to keep his word. His conscience became thereupon
disturbed, and he had troubles of mind and of heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
which were skilfully turned against the heretics by Father
La Chaise, who had been promoted about a year before to
the office of the king’s confessor. The Reformed were made
to atone for the faults of the monarch, and to reconcile him
with his offended God by their abjuration, or their ruin.</p>

<p>The religion of Louis XIV. was of this kind. If he had
not sufficient piety to conquer his passions, he had enough
bigotry to imagine that he could expiate his errors by the
reduction of heretics to the Roman unity. Louis XIV.
received his first religious ideas from a Spanish mother, who,
very ignorant herself, had impressed his mind with many
petty scruples, and but little enlightenment on faith and
Christian morality. The Jesuits had continued her work,
by inspiring their pupil with sentiments, which might subserve
for the accomplishment of their designs.</p>

<p>Having understood at a later period how badly he had
been educated, he remodelled his education as to those matters
which most interested the dignity and authority of his
crown. Unhappily, he remained just where he was in
respect of religious matters, and his habits were no better
than his spiritual convictions. “He never had a proper
idea of his duties,” says M. de Sismondi. It was not only
his amours which deserve censure, although the scandal of
their publicity, the dignities to which he raised the children
of his adultery, and the constant humiliation to which he
subjected his wife, add greatly to his offence against public
morality. He made himself besides deeply guilty by the
merciless cruelty with which he shed blood, at one time by
such executions as those he inflicted upon the Bretons to
punish them for having defended their privileges, at another
by the ruin of entire populations. No respect for engagements,
no notion of right or wrong, regulated either his
public or his private conduct. He violated treaties just as
he violated his domestic engagements; he seized the property
of his subjects, as well as that of his cousin, Mademoiselle de
Montpensier. He acknowledged in his judgments, and in
his rigour towards his people, no rule but his own will. At the
very moment that his subjects were dying of famine, he retrenched
nothing from his prodigalities. Those, who boasted
of having converted him, had never represented to him more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
than two duties, that of renouncing his incontinence, and
that of extirpating heresy in his dominions.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Rulhières confesses these errors of mind and conduct,
while he strives to elevate the character of Louis XIV. in a
memoir, which was intended for the perusal of Louis XVI.:
“During these alternatives of dissoluteness and scruples,”
says he, “while he passed from error to remorse, and from
remorse to error, he hoped to redeem his transgressions and
merit more decisive grace from heaven, by labouring with
greater fervour for these conversions.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>One of the means that Louis XIV. employed with this
view, was the purchase of consciences for money; a fresh
proof of the detestable religious education he had received
from his mother and the Jesuits.</p>

<p>He consecrated to this vile traffic the third of the <i lang="fr">économats</i>
or benefices, which fell to the crown during vacancy. The
amount was not large; but it was increased afterwards by
leaving benefices vacant expressly to pay for the abjurations
of the heretics.</p>

<p>Pellisson had the administration of this fund. Although
born in the Reformed communion, he had embraced (Roman)
Catholicism very opportunely for his fortune, and from a
convert had become a converter. Doubly an object of suspicion
to the king from his Huguenot origin, and his connection
with the superintendent Fouquet, he perceived that
he must do much to gain the favour of Louis. Nor did he
spare his efforts.</p>

<p>The establishment opened by Pellisson was a bank, or
commercial house, organized according to the rules of [establishments
of] the kind, with its correspondents, who were
generally priests or bishops, its tariff, its letters of change,
its provincial agents, and its regular balance-sheets of expenditure;
and it was made necessary to send certificates of
abjuration duly signed, and acquittances in proper form, indicating
the sum disbursed for each person, or for each family
of proselytes.</p>

<p>The object of this bank was naturally to procure conversions
at the lowest figure: they cost from five to six livres,
sometimes one or two pistoles, and, in extraordinary cases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
from eighty to one hundred francs. There is a curious letter
on this subject from Pellisson extant, which is the circular
of a consummate merchant. “Although you may go to the
extent of a hundred francs,” [he writes,] “you are not thereby
to understand that this sum is to be always given, since it is
requisite that the utmost economy should be observed; first,
in order that this beneficent dew may be dispersed over the
greatest number of persons; and secondly, because, if a hundred
francs is given to persons of low rank without any
family following them, those who have ever so little position,
or draw after them a number of children, will demand much
larger sums. This will not, however, prevent, where important
strokes may be effected, on my being first advised
thereof, larger remittances to be furnished, accordingly as
his majesty shall, on representation made to him, think
proper.” (June 12th, 1677.)</p>

<p>Pellisson regularly presented lists of six and eight hundred
converts with the certificates to the king, and caused
his miracles to be inserted in the <cite>Gazette</cite>. He took care,
however, not to publish that they were nearly all folks belonging
to the dregs of the people, or rogues who made a
trade of their consciences, or wretches who took the money
that they might have the wherewithal to buy a piece of
bread, without any intention of renouncing their religion.
The king was greatly astonished at his conquests; the prelates
applauded; the Jesuits triumphed; but sensible people
put no faith in them.</p>

<p>In effect, frauds multiplied to such an extent, that it could
no longer be concealed from the king. Instead, however, of
giving up this unworthy traffic, he published, through his
council, in the month of March, 1679, a law of greater severity
against those who relapsed. “We have been informed,” he
says in the preamble, “that in several provinces of our kingdom,
there are many persons, who, after having abjured the
pretended Reformed religion, in the hope of participating in
the sums that we have caused to be distributed to the new
converts, return to it again.” And the law pronounced
against them, besides the former penalty of banishment for
life, was that of public recantation and forfeiture of property.</p>

<p>What a mass of injustice and contradictions! In buying
souls it could not but be supposed that they believed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
nothing, and after having bought them, they were punished
for changing anew,—as if they had believed in anything.
What should so degraded a devotion inspire in the minds of
all respectable people? Is it pity or contempt? It is both
the one and the other.</p>

<p>The peace of Nimeguen, concluded with all the powers of
Europe in 1679, was the apogee of the fortunes of Louis XIV.
He [then] received the surname of “the Great.” Courtiers
and men of letters were profuse in [offering] the most humble
adulations, and treated him as a demigod. This incense
completed his intoxication—he regarded himself really as the
sole and rightful owner of all the territory of his kingdom,
the sole legislator and supreme judge, the living impersonation
of the whole state! He ended by thinking that the
minds of his subjects were as much his slaves as their bodies,
and considered every conscientious opposition to his sovereign
will to be a crime of high treason. Unfortunate prince!
He never so debased himself as when he carried the excess
of his pretensions so high.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon [now] began to assume a stronger
dominion over him. The grand-daughter of Agrippa
d’Aubigné, one of the firmest defenders of the Calvinist faith,
and herself deeply devoted to her religion in childhood, she
had abandoned it in 1651, when sixteen years of age. When
the Reformed saw her growing in the confidence and intimacy
of Louis XIV., they imagined that she would remember
the communion of her grandfather, and use her influence
to protect it. But having been “<em>born ambitious</em>,” as she
confesses in one of her letters, she felt, even more than Pellisson,
the necessity of causing her heretic origin to be forgotten,
and hoped to retain the king’s heart by fostering in
him a strict devotion.</p>

<p>Gifted with much cleverness and still more tact, she had
easily discovered Louis XIV.’s profound repugnance for the
heretics, and tried to conform herself to it. It appears,
nevertheless, that she had some compunctions of pity for
the oppressed. We read in the <cite>Memorial of Saint Cyr</cite>, that
the king said to her one day: “I fear, madam, that the
moderation you would have me display for the heretics arises
from some remains of affection for your old religion.” And
she writes elsewhere: “Ruvigny is intractable; he has told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the king that I was born a Calvinist, and that I was one
until my coming to court. This compels me to approve of
things quite opposite to my sentiments.”</p>

<p>This avowal is the clue to her conduct. Madame de
Maintenon, if left to herself, would have employed only
mildness and charity, as she recommended to her brother;
but being desirous above all things of pleasing Louis XIV.,
she joined with Father La Chaise in devising every means
for the ruin of heresy.</p>

<p>The plan of destruction became systematic and invariable
after the peace of Nimeguen. Governors, commandants,
intendants, soldiers, lawyers, finding that Louis had finally
decided upon the extirpation of the Huguenots, became
animated with a great desire for proselytism, and undertook
in their turn to become missionaries and converters. Their
chief care was to despatch long lists of abjurations to the
court, or at least reports of worship interdicted, of places of
worship razed, and of flocks dispersed. The privy council
was sometimes alarmed at so much zeal; notwithstanding
which it dared not arrest it, lest the victims might be encouraged
in their resistance; and soon, itself drawn along
by the force of circumstances, it transformed into a general
declaration what it had blamed at first.</p>

<p>Whenever a councillor or a magistrate more humane than
the others, deplored these extreme measures, the only answer
was, “God uses all means for His ends.”</p>

<p>The populace, as might have been expected, acted its part
in these persecutions. In the towns of Blois, Alençon, and
in other places, bands of wretches invaded the places of
worship, tore the holy books, broke the pulpits and the
benches, and set fire to the buildings: the authorities, instead
of suppressing these riots, sanctioned them by the interdiction
of worship and the exile of the pastors.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. persisted, nevertheless, in talking to the Protestant
powers of Europe of his respect for the Edict of
Nantes. We read in a declaration so late even as 1682, that
he was resolved upon doing nothing contrary to the edicts,
by virtue of which the pretended Reformed religion was
tolerated in his kingdom! Under the Valois, persecution
was cruel, but freely avowed; under Louis XIV. it cloaked
itself for a long time in hypocrisy: the Jesuits were the
moving power.</p>

<h3 id="BIII_XV">XV.</h3>
</div>


<p>As we gradually approach [the period of] the revocation,
the ordinances already so numerous, as we have seen, multiplied
with striking features of aggravation. We will class
the most important under distinct heads.</p>

<p><em>Public Offices.</em>—The exclusions were extended by degrees
to all employments without exception. The Reformed were
disabled from being councillors, judges, assessors, treasurers,
clerks in the financial departments, consuls, municipal magistrates,
advocates, notaries, procurators, serjeants, ushers,
physicians, apothecaries, librarians, printers, <i lang="fr">employés</i> in the
post [offices], and public conveyances, members of corporations,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Even midwives of the religion were no longer
permitted, “because they did not believe,” said the ordinance
of 1680, “baptism to be necessary, and could not christen
children on emergency.”</p>

<p>In certain cantons it was physically impossible to execute
these edicts; for how could the Reformed be excluded from
all employments and every office in those places where they
formed nearly the whole of the population? It was necessary
to select consuls and municipal councillors from adventurers
living in the suburbs, and from people of no character, which
caused inexpressible disorder.</p>

<p><em>Civil Rights.</em>—There were no longer any guarantees in the
courts of justice. The chambers of the Edict, at Paris and
Rouen, had been abolished in 1669. The mixed chambers
of the Parliaments of Toulouse, Grenoble, and Bordeaux
were abolished in 1679; “seeing,” said the preamble, “that
all animosity was extinct!” Derision was added to the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes!</p>

<p>It was not an unfrequent occurrence to hear the (Roman)
Catholic party invoke this argument, in affairs purely civil:
“I plead against a heretic;” and when a member of the
Reformed faith complained of an unjust sentence, he was
coolly answered: “You have your remedy in your hands;
why do you not become a Catholic?”</p>

<p><em>Marriage and Paternal Authority.</em>—Alliances were no
longer permitted between the Reformed and (Roman) Catholics,
even in the case of former relations that marriage
had legitimized. The Reformed were not allowed to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
(Roman) Catholic valets, for fear the latter should be seduced;
and soon, by an inverse excess, they were prohibited from
having any other than (Roman) Catholics, because such could
be employed as spies. The nearest relations were prohibited
from being guardians or curators. Fathers and mothers
were forbidden to send their children into foreign countries
before the age of sixteen. It was ordered that all illegitimate
children, of every age and condition, should be held
as (Roman) Catholics, and educated in that religion: and
as this ordinance was made to act retrospectively, results
flowed from it as ridiculous as they were odious. Persons
of sixty and eighty years of age were summoned to enter
the church of Rome, because their illegitimate condition had
legally rendered them (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>Matters even went further than this. An edict of the
17th of June, 1681, declared that the children of the Reformed
might abjure at the age of <em>seven</em>. “We will, and it
pleaseth us,” said the ordinance, “that our said subjects of
the pretended Reformed religion, as well male as female,
having attained the age of seven years, may, and it shall be
lawful for them to, embrace the Catholic, Apostolic, and
Roman religion, and, for this end, that they be received to
make abjuration, without their fathers and mothers and other
relatives offering <em>the least impediment</em>, under any pretext
whatsoever!” These children were free to withdraw themselves
whenever they liked, and the parents were bound to
provide them with a pension for their maintenance.</p>

<p>Fearful consequences attended [the passing of] this law.
Every family was disturbed. Friends, (Roman) Catholic
neighbours, servants, the slightest mark of kindness to their
children on the part of a stranger, were mistrusted. A
priest, an envious acquaintance, an enemy, a discontented
talebearer, might declare before a justice that such and such
a child had made the sign of the cross, or kissed an image of
the Virgin, or desired to enter a (Roman) Catholic church;
and this was often sufficient to justify their abduction, particularly
of those who were rich enough to pay an allowance,
and to shut them up in some convent under the direction of
monks, nuns, and the [secular] clergy.</p>

<p>Even Madame Maintenon made use of this abominable law.
Having vainly endeavoured to convert her relation, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
Marquis de Villette, who had replied to her: “It would take
me a hundred years to believe in infallibility, twenty years
to believe in the real presence,” and so on, she deprived him
of his children; among others of a little girl, who afterwards
became the Marchioness de Caylus. We read in the Memoirs
of this lady: “I cried a great deal, but I found next day
the royal mass so beautiful that I consented to be a (Roman)
Catholic, on condition that I should hear it every day,
and that I should be insured from all whipping. This
was all the controversy employed, and the only abjuration I
made.”</p>

<p><em>Contracts and Imposts.</em>—The newly-converted were permitted
to delay the payment of their debts for the space of
three years, which attracted all involved or dishonest debtors
to (Roman) Catholicism. These same converts were also
exempt for two years from imposts and military quarterings;
while a double imposition of billets, taxes, or arbitrary contributions,
called <em>office taxes</em>, were inflicted upon the refractory,
so that the treasury might not suffer by its liberality.
Colbert complained in vain of the disorder and confusion
which this caused; religion, however, took the precedence
of financial regularity.</p>

<p><em>Attacks upon Property.</em>—All the funds, rents, and other
property of every kind which belonged to the condemned
churches, were confiscated in favour of the (Roman) Catholic
hospitals: so likewise were all those destined to the poor of
the religion, even in the places where its exercise had not
been interdicted; and testamentary dispositions containing
charitable legacies for the consistories were annulled. We
shall see, as we proceed, to what point the attack upon
private property was (also) carried.</p>

<p><em>Liberty of Conscience and of Worship.</em>—Physicians, surgeons,
and others, who should assist the sick of the Reformed
religion, were commanded to give notice thereof to the magistrates
of the locality, under penalty of a fine of five hundred
livres; and the latter—consuls, judges, or magistrates—were
required to visit the sick, willingly or by force, with or
without a priest, to ask them if they would abjure.</p>

<p>The pastors were forbidden to speak of the <em>misfortune of
the times</em> in their sermons, to attack the Romish church
directly or indirectly, to reside at a distance of less than six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
leagues from the places of interdicted worship, and of less
than three leagues from the places of contested worship.
The people were forbidden to assemble in their places of
worship under pretence of prayer and singing psalms, except
at the usual hours. The conferences were definitively interdicted;
and the consistories were obliged to admit a (Roman)
Catholic commissioner. It was prohibited to contribute
alms for the maintenance of the sick of the Reformed religion,
or to take care of them in private houses; the order
was to transfer them to the hospitals, where they fell under
the action of Roman proselytism.</p>

<p>The crowning measure of oppression was the prohibition
to receive any new converts in the places of worship, under
pain of banishment and forfeiture of property, as regarded
the pastors, and of privation of religious exercises, as regarded
the flocks. At this last blow the Reformed were
ready to abandon themselves to despair. Many deliberated
whether they ought not to renounce all public service, and
confine themselves to the adoration of God within their own
houses. What refinement of barbarity! To force them
themselves to watch the door of their places of worship, and
to drive away the brethren, who had doubtless quitted them,
but who returned perhaps with tears of repentance! Besides,
by what signs was a new convert distinguished? How was
it possible to know all those who had abjured? Might not
one traitor procure the condemnation of an entire church?
The places of worship at Bergerac, Montpellier, Saint Quentin,
and Montauban, were demolished in this way: the
same fate threatened all the others.</p>

<p>It appeared as if the condition of the Reformed could not
become worse. It did so, however, by the intervention of
the Marquis de Louvois, who wanted, according to the expression
of Madame de Caylus, to mix up the soldiery with the
affair. He was annoyed that he was, after the peace of
Nimeguen, no longer necessary to his master, and saw with
displeasure devotion replacing gallantry in the heart of Louis.
He tried long and fruitlessly to bring the king back to
Madame de Montespan; but when he was convinced that his
intrigues were useless, and that the sole means of pleasing
Louis was to second his efforts for the conversion of the
Huguenots, he entered into them with all the violence of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
character, being only too happy to play the first part with
the help of the troops at his disposal. What miseries, what
shameful calculations in that court, so renowned, and all
under the mask of Catholic piety!</p>

<p>Louvois wrote to Marillac, intendant at Poitou, in the
month of March, 1681, that he was about to send a regiment
of horse into that province. “His majesty,” he said,
“has heard with much joy of the great number of persons,
who continue to be converted in your department. He
wishes you to persist in your endeavours, and desires that
the greater number of horsemen and officers should be
billeted upon the Protestants. If, according to a just distribution,
ten would be quartered upon the members of the
Reformed religion, you may order them to accommodate
twenty.” Louvois also enjoined that the communication of
his orders should be made to the mayors and authorities, not
by writing, but by word of mouth, so that it might not be
said that the king used violence towards the Huguenots.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of those <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>, which have left
an indelible stain of disgrace upon the reign of Louis XIV.,
and of horror in the mind of the inhabitants. The march
of Marillac’s troops was ordered, as if they were in an
enemy’s country, exacting arrears of taxes, exempting those
who became converts, and throwing all the burden upon the
obstinate. From four to ten dragoons were billeted in the
houses, with directions not to kill the inhabitants, but with
authority to do anything short of that, in order to extort an
abjuration. Curates followed the soldiers in the towns and
villages, shouting: “Courage, gentlemen, it is the will of
the king.”</p>

<p>Without a check upon their passions, the military committed
horrible excesses: a horde of brigands had penetrated
into the heart of the kingdom. The <cite>Journal of Jean Migault</cite>,
published in these later times, will give an idea of their barbarities.
Devastations, pillages, tortures, cruelties [prevailed;
in fact,] they hesitated at nothing.</p>

<p>Elie Bénoit has filled page after page of his <cite>History of the
Edict of Nantes</cite> [with a narrative of these cruelties]; we will
only extract one or two passages: “The horsemen,” he
writes, “fastened crosses to the mouth of their musquetoons
to compel the people to kiss them by force, and when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
met with any resistance, they thrust their crosses into the
face and stomach of their unhappy victims. They spared
children as little as persons of more advanced age, and
without the slightest regard for their years; they loaded
them with blows with the flat of their swords, or with the
butt-end of their musquetoons; such was their violence that
in many instances many were crippled for life. These infamous
wretches took a pleasure in maltreating women.
They beat them with whips; they struck them in the face with
canes in order to disfigure them; they dragged them by their
hair in the mud and over the stones. Sometimes the soldiers,
meeting labourers on the road, or with their carts, drove
them to the (Roman) Catholic churches, pricking them like
cattle with their own spurs, to hasten their unwilling
march....”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Crowds of unfortunates fled to the woods; others hid
themselves in the houses of their friends; many determined
to fly the kingdom at all hazards; and there might be seen
men, women, and children, half-dead, stretched upon the
stones or rugged rocks. Many at length consented to abjure
under the sabre of the soldier; but what an abjuration!
Numbers went mad, or died of grief, or put an end to their
days in paroxysms of remorse and despair. There were
some who, flinging themselves upon the road, beat their
breasts and filled the air with wailings. “When any two of
these unfortunate converts met,” still further relates Bénoit,
“when one beheld the other at the foot of an image, or in
any other act of Catholic devotion, their cries redoubled,
and their grief burst out anew. The labourer, abandoned to
his reflections during his work, felt the sharp stimulus of
remorse, and quitting his waggon in the midst of his fields,
threw himself upon his knees, and while prostrate on the
earth, sought for pardon, and took all nature to witness that
it was violence alone that he had obeyed.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon wrote to her brother, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
about to receive a gratuity of eight hundred thousand francs:
“I beg of you carefully to use the money you are about to
receive. Estates in Poitou may be got for nothing; the
desolation of the Huguenots will drive them to sell more.
You may easily acquire extensive possessions in Poitou.”
(September 2nd, 1681.)</p>

<p>The emigration, suspended in 1669, recommenced upon a
vaster scale, and thousands of families quitted France. The
Protestant countries, England, Switzerland, Holland, and
Denmark, offered them shelter by official declarations. The
court became alarmed, above all when the heads of the administration
of the navy complained of the desertion of a
great number of sailors, who, having readier means of flight,
escaped <i lang="fr">en masse</i>. Marillac was recalled, and the other intendants
received orders to act with less severity.</p>

<p>The ordinances, which interdicted departure from the
kingdom, were again put in force, with the addition of the
penalty of perpetual imprisonment at the galleys against the
heads of families, a fine of three thousand livres for those
who should encourage them to fly, and the nullification of all
contracts of sale made by the Reformed one year before
their emigration. This last article overturned all private
transactions, and it became necessary to supply a remedy on
its execution.</p>

<p>The laws against emigrants and those who relapsed, placed
a double-edged sword in the hands of the persecutors. If
the new converts re-entered a place of worship, they were
stricken with a terrible punishment, and they were equally
so if they endeavoured to quit the kingdom. The government
would consider them only as (Roman) Catholics in
France; on the frontier they were seized as heretics.
Rulhières, always led by a desire to justify the memory of
Louis XIV., says that “the misfortunes of the Reformed
were principally due to the combination of these two laws,
of which their originator, Father La Chaise, boasted, as
master-pieces of genius.”</p>

<p>The assembly of the clergy, who had to secure the pardon
of the Roman See for the temerity of the four propositions
of 1682, sent a <em>pastoral notice</em> to all the consistories of
France, in which it was said that the bishops looked upon
the Huguenots as strayed sheep, and would welcome them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
with open arms, but that they would be discharged from the
care of their souls, if the heretics were not convinced by
these charitable words. “This last error,” the prelates wrote,
“will be more criminal in you than all the others, and you
must expect misfortunes incomparably more dreadful and
disastrous than all those your revolt and schism have drawn
upon you at present.”</p>

<p>This notice of the clergy was read in the consistories by
the express command of the king. It converted nobody;
but every one foresaw fresh sufferings; for those who uttered
the prediction had influence enough to work its accomplishment.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIII_XVI">XVI.</h3>
</div>


<p>It is evident how intolerable the condition of the Reformed
must have become. They had no longer rights of any
kind, guarantees or safety; their persons, their children,
their property, were all at the mercy of the oppressor; the
sword of proscription hung incessantly suspended over their
heads. What race in the Christian world was ever more
unhappy than this?</p>

<p>A multitude of fugitives already filled Europe with their
complaints and their wailings. Jurieu, who had found an
asylum in Holland, wrote in 1682, in his book upon the
<cite lang="fr">Politique du Clergé de France</cite>, “We are treated as if we
were enemies of the Christian name. In places where the
Jews are tolerated, they have all kinds of privileges; they
encourage the arts and commerce; they are physicians;
they are consulted; they are intrusted with the health and
lives of Christians. And we, as if we were infamous, are
forbidden to approach newborn children; we are banished
from the bar and the faculties; we are kept from the presence
of the king; we are despoiled of our offices; we are forbidden
the use of all the means of providing against perishing of
hunger; we are abandoned to the hatred of the populace;
we are deprived of that precious liberty that we have bought
with so many services; our children, who are a part of ourselves,
are torn from us.... Are we Turks? Are we
infidels? We believe in Jesus Christ; we believe Him to
be the eternal Son of God, the Redeemer of the world; the
maxims of our morality are so pure that none dare gainsay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
them; we respect kings; we are good subjects, good citizens;
we are as much Frenchmen as Reformed Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Jurieu spoke in vain. The books of heretics could not
pass the frontier. It was even attempted in the interior
of the kingdom to destroy the ancient works which attacked
(Roman) Catholicism. The archbishop of Paris drew up a
catalogue comprising the names of five hundred authors, and
domiciliary visits were paid in the houses of the ministers
and the elders, in order to burn all the condemned books
that might be found in their libraries.</p>

<p>The Reformed transmitted petition after petition to the
court, the council, and to the king himself. Their cause
was pleaded by the deputy-general, or by special delegates.
Sometimes they recapitulated their grievances in general
requests, conjoining the most humble protestations of obedience
and respect.</p>

<p>All was useless. The ministers of state disputed the best-supported
facts, and threatened the petitioners with still
direr treatment. The king closed his palace, or when, after
long remonstrance, they were admitted, his words were cold
and constrained. The deputy-general Ruvigny, having
represented to him the great misery of more than two
millions of Frenchmen, Louis XIV., it is said, answered him
that to “bring all his subjects back to the Catholic unity,
he would give one of his arms, or would cut off one of his
hands with the other.” This saying filled the Reformed
with the darkest presentiments.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they persisted in believing that Louis XIV.,
the grandson of the Béarnese, would have compassion upon
them, if he knew the extent of their sufferings, and filled
with this idea, they resolved to make a last effort.</p>

<p>Sixteen deputies from Languedoc, Cevennes, Vivarais,
and Dauphiny, met secretly at Toulouse, in the spring of
1683, and drew up a draft in eighteen articles, destined to
restore their liberty of conscience and of worship, without,
however, doing the slightest act which could bear the
appearance of rebellion. After enjoining repentance, prayer,
and union among the faithful, they decided that on the 27th
of June following, all the interdicted assemblies should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
recommence at the same time, without ostentation, but also
without mystery, with open doors, or upon the ruins of the
razed places of worship. Those who had performed a forced
abjuration were to assemble separately, for fear of furnishing
the pretext for fresh persecutions. On the 4th of July,
a solemn fast was to be celebrated in all the churches. The
pastors were exhorted to remain courageously in the midst of
their flocks, and not to quit them, but with the leave of
a conference, or in the most imminent peril. Lastly, the
deputies framed a petition to the chancellor and all the
ministers of state, in which they pledged their obedience to
the king in everything that was not absolutely contrary to
their duty to God. “What is our situation?” they said;
“if we obey, it is pretended that we are converted, and our
very submission is made use of to deceive the king.”</p>

<p>The chief object of this bold measure was to prove to
Louis XIV. that the abjurations <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, which were
recounted to him, were unworthy fabrications. Unhappily,
there was not sufficient unanimity among the oppressed.
The prudent, the timid, those who had not suffered so much
as others, those who saw danger only when it was upon them,
determined to abstain from the enterprise, and stood apart.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, however, a great many houses of
worship were reopened, the assemblies were reconstituted,
and religious service was again performed in many places
where it had been interdicted. The military governors and
the intendants immediately took alarm; they believed, or
feigned to believe, that a general insurrection was taking
place, and troops were sent against these poor peasants, who,
pleading the solemn promises of the Edict of Nantes, had
met together to read the Bible and to pray.</p>

<p>The Marquis d’Aguesseau, the father of the illustrious
chancellor of the same name, and intendant of Languedoc,
advised that a stop should be put to the barbarities of the
soldiers; but Louvois refused, and ordered frightful executions.
The peasants were tracked in the woods, and
slaughtered by hundreds. “<em>It was a butchery without a combat</em>,”
says Rulhières. “Their places of worship were thrown
down, and their houses razed. Pardon was offered to the
prisoners on condition that they should abjure: they would
not comply, and were hanged!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>The Reformers of Vivarais and Dauphiny, reduced to
despair, sought to defend themselves by force. Louvois
promised them an amnesty, but his promise was derisive.
All the ministers and fifty other prisoners were exempted
from it, without counting those that were sent to the galleys.
The pastor, Isaac Hornel, an old man of seventy-two, who
was accused of having fomented the disturbances, was condemned
to be broken alive on the wheel, although the most
inveterate criminals were never subjected to so terrible a
punishment in those times. The executioner, who made
himself drunk for the task, inflicted more than thirty blows
upon him before he killed him, accompanying the torture
with dastardly insults. Hornel died with the constancy of
a martyr (16th of October, 1683).</p>

<p>In several provinces there were left no more than one or
two places of worship, and these were interdicted under the
least pretext. The church of Marennes, in Saintonge, for
instance, which still remained, was soon suppressed in its
turn, with accompanying circumstances of an odious nature.
This church comprised from thirteen to fourteen thousand
persons; but because, as was pretended, some who had
relapsed, and some children of new converts had entered the
places of worship, their services were prohibited by a decree
notified at the very last moment, on the night before
Sunday (1684).</p>

<p>On the sabbath, more than ten thousand of the faithful
arrived before the doors of their place of worship, and among
them were twenty-three children, who had been brought a
distance of seven leagues for baptism. As the weather was
extremely inclement, several died on the way. “The people,
as they withdrew,” says Elie Bénoit, “loudly expressed their
grief. Nothing was heard but cries, and weeping, and wailing.
There was no restraint either in the streets or in the
country. Parents and friends embraced in tears and without
uttering a word. Men and women, with clasped hands, and
eyes raised to heaven, clung to the holy place whither they
had come, regardless of the severity of the season, to find
consolation in praying to God; and yet, amidst so sad a
scene, it was necessary that they should be watchful to give
no new hold to their persecutors, by remaining in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
numbers upon a spot where the decree against the pastors
rendered such meetings unlawful.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>It is gratifying to add, that if the persecution was great,
the very sufferings of the people strengthened their piety.
There were provinces where the faithful made a journey of
fifty and even sixty leagues to be present at the religious
service; and not only did men in the vigour of manhood,
but old men of eighty took the road, on foot, with staff in
hand, enduring all the fatigues and dangers of the journey,
in order that they might have the consolation of praying
together with their brethren for the last time. The first-comers
found an asylum in the place of worship, while the
others halted around it, singing psalms or reading prayers.
And as these assemblies would have been esteemed unlawful
without the presence of a minister, the preacher passed the
night with them, exhorting them by his tears as much as by
his discourses, to remain steadfast in the faith.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, as all the ministers had been exiled or imprisoned,
the intendants were under the necessity of summoning
pastors from other places, to baptize the children,
and to celebrate marriages, “without the addition of any
sermon, exhortation, or service of the pretended Reformed
religion.” These pastors were kept under guard, as if they
were pest-smitten, and they were taken back as soon as they
had given to the acts of the heretics the civil sanction, which
in those times was confounded with the religious blessing.</p>

<p>The court was not yet satisfied. Louis XIV., who had
just contracted a secret marriage with Madame de Maintenon,
had passed from ignorant devotion to outrageous bigotry.
He was irritated by the obstacles that delayed the general
conversion of the Reformers, and, governed by the triumvirate
of Father La Chaise, Madame de Maintenon, and the
Marquis de Louvois, his mind gradually familiarized itself
with the idea of altogether abrogating the Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Châteauneuf, who had the charge of
ecclesiastical affairs, was opposed to precipitating matters,
saying, that “it was unwise to put too much fuel upon the
fire.” Louvois himself seemed for a moment to incline
towards moderation. The other secretaries of state were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
the contrary opinion; and the aged chancellor Letellier,—a
false and unfeeling man, of whom the Count de Grammont
said, when he saw him come from an interview with the
king, “I see a ferret licking his muzzle, bloody with the
slaughter of fowls,”—wanted the work to be accomplished
before his death.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon thus wrote on the 13th of August,
1684: “The king is prepared to do everything that shall be
judged useful for the welfare of religion. This undertaking
will cover him with glory before God and man.” Glory!
She did not foresee that, far from increasing the glory of
Louis, the Edict of Revocation would impress an indelible
stain upon his reign, and that posterity would inquire whether
he had not, by this single act, more injured the material
power and the policy of France than he had benefited it by
his conquest of Flanders, Alsatia, and Franche-Comté.</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1685, the clergy held a general
assembly, and complimented the king upon the admirable
success, which had attended his efforts to extirpate heresy.
Louis was extolled above the greatest princes of Christian
antiquity. The bishop of Valence and the coadjutor of
Rouen said, “he had found the (Roman) Catholic church
cast down and enslaved; but he had re-established it by his
zeal; he had <em>without violence and without arms</em> induced all
rational persons to abandon heresy, had subdued their minds
by winning their hearts with his favours, and had led back
wanderers, who <em>would perchance never have returned to the
bosom of the Church, had it not been for the flowery path he had
thrown open to them</em>.” We copy these words as they were
actually spoken, and will add nothing to them!</p>

<p>Rulhières, who was permitted to search the state papers,
when speaking of the intervention of the priests in the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, says, “I hold in my hands a
collection of the letters of the clergy, some of which cause
me to shudder.”</p>


<div class="chapter">

</div>


<p>Troops had been encamped in Béarn, in 1685, to watch
the movements of the Spanish army; and as Spain had
sought a truce, Louvois, mindful of the plan adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
Marillac in Poitou, obtained the king’s permission to despatch
some regiments to the districts inhabited by the Huguenots.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Boufflers, commander of the troops, and
the intendant Foucault received, in July, the order to complete
the conversion of the Béarnese. The latter brought a
refined and systematic cruelty to his task, and perfected more
than one species of torture. This was the recommencement
of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>, which were soon to spread over all
France.</p>

<p>Foucault announced that the king commanded all the
Huguenots to return to the (Roman) Catholic unity, and to
make a beginning of the business, drove some hundreds of
Béarnese into a church by force, where the bishop of Lescar
officiated. The doors were closed, and the unfortunate people
were made to kneel by the force of blows, in order to receive
the bishop’s absolution from heresy: they were then admonished
that if they returned to the Protestant church, they
would be punished for relapsing.</p>

<p>The Reformed fled to the fields, the forests, the wildernesses,
and the caverns of the Pyrenees. Foucault ordered
them to be pursued like wild beasts; and when they were
brought back to their dwellings, he loaded them with military
billetings. The horrors committed in Poitou were
renewed and even surpassed.</p>

<p>The dragoons or other soldiers (for troops of all kinds were
employed), entered the houses of the Reformers with drawn
swords, shouting: “<em>Kill! kill!</em> or let them become <em>Catholics</em>!”
They wasted provisions, spoiled furniture, and destroyed or
sold everything that fell into their hands to the peasants of
the neighbourhood. Nor were the persons of the Calvinists
spared. “Among other secrets taught them by Foucault,”
says the historian of the Edict of Nantes, “he ordered them
to keep strict guard over those, who would not succumb to
other tortures. The faithful executioners of these furious
orders watched in relays, that they might not themselves
sink under the torments they inflicted upon others. The
sound of drums, blasphemies, shouts; the crashing of furniture,
or throwing them one upon another; the agitation in which
they kept these poor folks, to compel them to remain standing,
and to keep their eyes open, were the means they employed
to deprive them of repose. Pinching, pricking, buffeting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
and suspending them with ropes, blowing tobacco
smoke into their nostrils and mouths, and a hundred other
cruelties, were the sport of these ruffians, who by such means
reduced their hosts to a condition of not knowing what they
did, and of promising everything to rid themselves of such
barbarians. The women were forced to suffer indescribable
indignities.... The monsters never showed signs of pity
until they saw some one ready to die, and fainting with
exhaustion. Then, with cruel compassion, they restored the
sufferer to sense, in order that renewed strength might preserve
their victim for fresh violence. Their whole study and
endeavour was to invent torments which should be painful
without being mortal, and to afflict these unhappy objects of
their fury with every [suffering], which the human body
could endure without dying.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>They had been forbidden to kill [their victims]. Alas!
how often was even this limit outstepped! How many unfortunates
perished under this frightful treatment, not slain,
it is true, but more cruelly immolated, than if they had fallen
by the blade of the dagger!</p>

<p>Impelled by their fears, the Béarnese hastened to the
priests in crowds to abjure. Of twenty-five thousand Reformers
that had been counted in this province up to that
time, not a thirtieth part remained. The clergy celebrated
their triumph by a high mass, at which the Parliament
were present in a body, and by general processions, in which
the new converts were dragged along.</p>

<p>This success encouraged the court to employ the same
means of conversion elsewhere; and in less than four months,
Languedoc, Guienne, Saintonge, Aunis, Poitou, Vivarais,
Dauphiny, Cevennes, Provence, and Gex, were scoured by
similar <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>. A little later, the system was extended
to the centre of the north of France, but with more precaution,
lest the cries of the victims should trouble Versailles,
where, as Madame de Sévigné relates, brilliant carousals,
with promotions of the knights of the Holy Ghost, were
held that year.</p>

<p>The most creditable historians are agreed respecting the
excesses that accompanied these <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>. It was almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
the same scene everywhere as at Béarn. Neither sex, age,
nor degree was spared. Aged cavaliers, who had shed their
blood for their country, had to suffer the same outrages.
Even those, who were of high birth, and hoped to find a
refuge in Paris or at the court, were maltreated or thrown
into prison by <i lang="fr">lettres de cachet</i>.</p>

<p>If any Huguenots held out against all this torture, they
were, after being despoiled and ruined, flung into dungeons,
whilst the women were immured in convents! Missionaries
for the former, and Sisters of Mercy for the latter, who left
their prisoners no single moment of peace until they had
promised to abjure, followed upon the heels of the soldiers.</p>

<p>If, sinking under these persecutions, they fell into a state
of stupor, imbecility, or insanity, they were made to sign
mechanically a piece of paper containing an abjuration, or to
pronounce words, of which they no longer knew the meaning,
and then they were reputed to be (Roman) Catholics.
Or again, they were drawn into an ambush, as happened to
the barons de Montbeton, de Meauzac, and de Vicose, and
people, posted for the purpose, forced them down upon their
knees, that the bishop might give them absolution.</p>

<p>The abjuration of the head of the house was not sufficient;
he was not exempt from the billeting of soldiers until he
had induced his wife, children, and servants to follow his
example; and if any fled, the father of the family was responsible
for them until they were recaptured.</p>

<p>The Reformers were summoned to a general meeting,
before the arrival of the soldiers; at which, according to the
time and the intention, the commanding officer of the troops,
the bishop or some other authority, announced that the king
would no longer suffer heretics in his dominions, and that all
must, willingly or unwillingly, embrace (Roman) Catholicism
immediately. Care was always taken to gain over some persons
beforehand, who by their station or advice, might help
to influence the rest.</p>

<p>When the poor folks answered that they were ready to
sacrifice their property and even their life for the king, but
not their conscience, then the dragoons were brought on the
scene. After a few days, there was a new convocation, a
new appeal, and generally all resistance ceased. The terror
became at length so great that the mere announcement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
the approach of the military, was sufficient to drive the
Reformed people, conscious of their helplessness, to pronounce
the formula of abjuration. It was the opinion
of many that it might be lawful to bend before violence,
provided their internal faith remained intact; many also
abjured, to secure the opportunity of flight.</p>

<p>It is also to be remarked that the formulas of recantation
were often drawn up in such a way that they did not bind
the conscience very strictly. What the public officers and
the priests were most desirous of, was a large number of proselytes.
Many of the Reformers simply said: “I rejoin.”
Others were even authorized to frame their act of abjuration
in these terms: “I acknowledge and confess the
Catholic and Apostolic church of Rome, as it was in the
time of the apostles;” or, “conformably to the doctrine of
our Lord Jesus Christ;” or, again, “while loving God and
Jesus Christ, and adoring Him only with the fitting worship.”</p>

<p>But this was, at least on the part of the priesthood, only
a concession for the moment. “They were soon revisited
after a few days,” says the pastor Claude in his <cite lang="fr">Plaintes des
Protestants de France</cite>, “and did not escape until they had
signed another formulary, whereby they were entirely committed;
and what was most impudent, is, that they were
obliged at the same time to acknowledge that they embraced
the Romish religion of their own free will, and without
any inducement through fear, or other extraneous cause. If,
after that, they made any difficulty about going to mass, if
they did not communicate, if they were not present at processions,
if they did not confess, if they did not tell their
beads, if they allowed a sigh or a murmur of complaint to
escape them, they were chastised with fines, and with a
recommencement of the billeting of soldiers upon them.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>What made a particular impression upon the population
was the material fact of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>. The spiritual circumstance
of the compulsory communions could but strike
the thinking and the pious man much more forcibly. To
open, one may say, the mouths of the heretics with the
point of the bayonet, and to thrust the host into them,—that
sacred host of which the (Roman) Catholic church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
teaches that he who receives it unworthily is guilty in the
highest degree—[could but do so]; and thus was a crime
enjoined even by those who proclaimed [an unworthy communion]
to be the greatest of crimes! Is there at this day a
bishop, or a priest, who does not recoil with horror from the
bottom of his heart from the thought? The Spanish Inquisition
had at least the decency to prevent its prisoners from
receiving the communion, and being present at mass. There
were, indeed, some noble and pious protests [offered] in the
era of Louis XIV., in particular by those of the Jansenist
party, to whom we shall have to refer; but the majority of
the clergy, led on by the Jesuits, compelled the unfortunate
beings to take the host, “whose pallor and tremblings,” writes
Basnage, “showed that their whole soul revolted from the act.”</p>

<p>The king’s council, which cared only for external acts, were
no less astonished than rejoiced at the innumerable abjurations.
Louvois wrote to his father, the chancellor, about the
beginning of September, 1685: “Sixty thousand conversions
have been made in the district of Bordeaux, and twenty
thousand in that of Montauban. So rapid is the progress,
that before the end of the month ten thousand Reformers
will not be left in the district of Bordeaux, where there were
one hundred and fifty thousand on the 15th of last month.”</p>

<p>The Duke de Noailles informed Louvois, at the same time,
of the conversions at Nismes, Uzès, Alais, Villeneuve, &amp;c.
“The most influential people of Nismes,” said he, “abjured
in the church, the day following my arrival. There was a
slackening afterwards, but matters soon assumed a proper
face, with the help of some billetings upon the dwellings
of the most obstinate.... The number of Reformers in this
province is about two hundred and forty thousand; I believe
that all this will be expedited before the termination of the
month.”</p>

<p>It was thought necessary to make these abjurations more
secure by a legal measure; Louis XIV.—surrounded and
besieged by his chancellor and his minister of war; ill-informed,
perhaps, of what was passing in his kingdom—for
he lived in the midst of favourites, like an Asiatic sultan in
the seclusion of his palace—Louis XIV., to whom Louvois
and La Chaise had promised that the work should not cost
one drop of blood; having also consulted, it is said, the archbishops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
Harlay and Bossuet—Louis XIV. signed the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes on the 18th of October, 1685.
God still permitted him to sit thirty years longer upon the
throne, that he might bear the burden of the crime he had
committed.</p>

<p>The preamble of the act of Revocation bears testimony to
the monstrous lie, with which the king’s mind had been
abused: “We now see,” it says, “with that just gratitude
we owe to God, that our endeavours have terminated as we
proposed, since the better and the greater portion of our subjects
of the pretended Reformed religion have embraced Catholicism,
and the Edict of Nantes therefore remaineth useless.”</p>

<p>Here is a recapitulation of the Revocatory Edict: Prohibition
for the future of all lawful exercise of the Reformed
worship in the kingdom. Exile of the pastors after the
lapse of fifteen days, and, in the interim, prohibition to
perform their functions, under penalty of the galleys. The
promise to the pastors who recanted, of a pension greater
by one-third than that they before enjoyed, with a reversion
of one-half to their widows. Dispensation from
academic studies for those of the pastors, who were desirous
of entering the profession of the law. Parents were prohibited
from instructing their children in the Reformed religion,
and were enjoined to have them baptized and sent to
(Roman) Catholic churches, under penalty of a fine of five
hundred livres. All the refugees were ordered to return to
France within four months, or to suffer confiscation of their
property. The Reformers were forbidden to emigrate, under
pain of the galleys for the men, and imprisonment for life
for the women. Finally, the laws against those who relapsed,
were confirmed.</p>

<p>The last article gave rise to a cruel mistake. It ran in
these words: “At the most is it lawful for the said persons
of the pretended Reformed religion, pending the pleasure of
God to enlighten them, to dwell in the towns and places of
our kingdom ... without being molested or troubled,
under pretext of the said Reformed religion, on condition, as
aforesaid, that there shall be no exercise of worship.” It
would, therefore, appear that liberty of conscience at home,
within the bosom of a family, was respected. The Reformed
rejoiced at this relief amidst their misfortunes, and some even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
suspended their preparations for departure; but never was
hope more bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p>The event showed, that these words, “<em>pending the pleasure
of God to enlighten them</em>,” signified, pending their conversion
by the dragoons, like their co-religionists. Louvois wrote to
the provinces: “His majesty desires that the severest
rigour should be shown to those who will not conform to his
religion, and those who seek the foolish glory of wishing to
be the last, must be pushed to the utmost extremity.”</p>

<p>The 18th of October, 1685, must be counted among the
darkest days of France. It brought trouble, poverty, and
humiliation upon many a generation.</p>

<p>The policy of Henry IV., of Richelieu, Mazarin, and even
of Louis XIV. himself, was struck to the core. It was no
longer possible to preserve the natural allies of France in
Protestant Europe, when the world resounded with the
piteous cries of the Reformed. All Protestantism rose
against Louis XIV.: it found a leader in the prince of
Orange, and the Parliamentary revolution of 1688 was the
answer to the royal attempt of 1685.</p>

<p>Less powerful abroad, the country was weakened within.
Emigration, of which we shall speak in the next book, assumed
immense proportions. The wise Vauban wrote, only
a year after the Revocation, that “France had lost a hundred
thousand inhabitants, sixty millions of money, nine thousand
sailors, twelve thousand tried soldiers, six hundred officers,
and its more flourishing manufactures.” The Duke de Saint-Simon
says in his memoirs, that “commerce was ruined in
every branch, and a quarter of the kingdom was sensibly
depopulated.”</p>

<p>From this moment (as all historians have remarked), the
fortunes of Louis XIV. declined; and some years after,
beaten at Blenheim, Ramilies, and Malplaquet, this king, so
fortunate and so superb in the beginning of his reign, humbly
sued to Europe for peace: and hard, indeed, were the
conditions which he obtained at Utrecht.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
whole of the eighteenth century, the kingdom bore the pain
of this humiliation; and even down to our own times, at
the Congress of Vienna.</p>

<p>The prestige of royalty was deeply wounded by the same
blow. If there still remained the appearance of submission
and respect, the mind began to revolt against the omnipotence
of the monarch. It was asked, whether nations ought
to confide every right and every power to a single man, who
might be governed by a female favourite, by a confessor, by a
foolish or a senseless passion for personal glory. In England,
and in Holland, popular liberty had vehement apologists.
In France, the pious Fénélon took the initiative, and was
followed by Massillon, Montesquieu, Rousseau, the Abbés
Mablay and Raynal, the Protestant Necker, and Mirabeau.
These men, although of such different origin, ideas, and
objects, all belong to the same family.</p>

<p>This was the political side of the question. In a social
and moral point of view, the edicts promulgated from 1660
to 1685, the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>, the Revocation, and the acts which
were its inevitable consequence, attacked the very foundations,
as it concerned two or three millions of Frenchmen,
of the sacred and inviolable principles of all human society,
religion, family, and property. The Socialists of modern
times have never carried their theories to such an extent,
as did Louis XIV., the Jesuits, the (Roman) Catholic
priesthood, and the magistracy against the Reformed. Let
every one of these, then, take their share of the responsibility.</p>

<p>Finally, in a religious point of view, properly speaking,
M. de Châteaubriand’s sentence respecting the massacre of
Saint Bartholomew,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which we have already mentioned elsewhere,
has at this point a new and striking application.
Beholding the narrow and pernicious bigotry of the king,
the hideous profanations sanctioned by the body of the
[Roman Catholic] clergy, the military transformed into
missionaries, mourning and blood mingled with religion, all
laws, human and divine, trodden underfoot by those, whose
especial duty it was to defend them, beholding all this, the
upper classes of the nation threw themselves into the wildest
scepticism. On the death of Louis XIV. the court was full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
of unbelievers, and Voltaire sprung ready armed from the
bosom of that generation.</p>

<p>It has been pretended that the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes was popular. If this were true, it would be the
most overwhelming accusation against the Church of Rome,
that it had thus educated and fashioned France. But it is
only half true. The Revocation was popular among the
priests, who, by the mouths of Fléchier and Bossuet, exhorted
their hearers to make the heavens resound with their thanksgivings
and their acclamations. It was popular with courtiers,
the Marquis Dangeau and Madame de Sévigné, who
worshipped the very footsteps of the monarch. It was popular
with the lowest classes of the country, particularly in the
southern provinces, who blindly obeyed the inspirations of
their spiritual guides. Perhaps, at the furthest, it was popular
with some ministers and government officials, who saw
no hope for civil <ins class="corr" id="tn-332" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and polical unity'">
and political unity</ins>, but through religious
unity. But was the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
popular among the officers of the army and navy, among the
provincial nobility, even among the court nobility, who had
not entirely sacrificed their independence of mind, or even
among the middle classes, destined to rise in influence in the
eighteenth century, and to govern in the nineteenth? Good
reason for doubting it may be gathered from what we have
stated above; and if we can now perceive but few traces of
their opposition, it is because it was difficult to utter a single
word freely under Louis XIV.</p>

<p>To sum up all in one word—everything suffered by the
Revocation; royalty suffered; the political strength of France
suffered; national wealth, industry, and morality suffered;
the spirit of religion suffered; nay, even the (Roman)
Catholic clergy suffered. Thus evil begets nothing but
misfortune!</p>

</div>


<p>Two opposite influences divided this period: the traditional
spirit of persecution, which still excited cruel violence and
frightful executions during the latter half of the eighteenth
century; and the new spirit of toleration, which, passing
from the conscience of men of worth into the writings of
philosophers, from these writings into the convictions of the
intelligent classes, from these classes into the legislature and
councils of the king, at length acquired an irresistible
authority, and compelled even the priesthood to bow before
maxims more true, more moral, more Christian than their
own.</p>

<p>When he affixed the seal of the state to the Edict of
Revocation, the Chancellor Letellier pronounced, with accents
of joy and triumph, the <i lang="la">Nunc dimittis</i> of Simeon. He, and
Louis XIV. with him, believed that the Edict would be a
final stroke [of policy]. It was then, on the contrary, that
the whole strife again began.</p>

<p>So long as the Reformed had had anything to lose, were
it only a shadow of their ancient liberty, were it only the
empty name of the Edict of Henry IV., the majority had
confined themselves to the limit of petitions and complaints.
They always trusted that the sacredness of the law, justice,
and humanity, would reappear in the heart of the monarch,
and they carried their resignation to such an extent, as to
originate the proverbial saying: “a Huguenot’s patience.”
But everything—absolutely everything, was lost; they consulted
no longer aught than what they owed to their conscience
and their outraged faith; and by the persevering
resolution to brave the most barbarous edicts at the cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
exile, the galleys, and death, they ended by wearying the
very ferocity of their executioners.</p>

<p>A solemn lesson springs out of the epoch on which we are
about to enter. It is easier to make martyrs than apostates;
and the violence of the sword, unless there be total extermination
(an impossibility in the reign of Louis XIV.), is
broken by the power of thought.</p>

<p>The act of Revocation was rigorously executed against the
pastors. The letter of the edict, which accorded fifteen
days’ delay for departure, was overstepped. Claude received
an order to quit [the country] within twenty-four hours, and
“<em>the man of sedition</em>,” as Madame de Maintenon called him,
was accompanied by one of the king’s servants, who never
lost sight of him for an instant. The other pastors of Paris
obtained two days for their preparations. Those of the
provinces had a little more time extended to them, but by a
complete denial of human and social rights, their children,
under the age of seven years, were taken away from them.
Some were even forced to abandon infants, which their
mothers were nursing, and started on the road of banishment
with wives, whose grievous woe scarcely left them strength
to accept their support.</p>

<p>It had been calculated that many of the pastors would
abjure; there were, however, but very few recantations;
for even those ministers, who had yielded in the first
movement of stupor and fear, almost all returned to their
ancient faith. Old men of eighty and ninety years of age
were seen bent on devoting the few remaining days of their
life to distant journeys, and more than one died before he
could reach an asylum where he might rest his wayworn
feet and aching head.</p>

<p>The arrival of these pastors produced an inexpressible
sensation in the foreign countries to which they went. On
all sides people hastened, with indignant and pitying hearts,
and tearful eyes, to salute these venerable confessors of the
Gospel, who, leaning on their traveller’s staff, came ahungered
and in rags, weeping for their children and their flocks, left
in the hands of the persecutors, to sit beside the hearth of
hospitality. A loud and fearful cry rose throughout all
Protestant Christendom against Louis XIV., and even the
(Roman) Catholics of those lands felt the flush of burning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
shame mantle upon their foreheads as they thought of their
dishonoured church.</p>

<p>The faithful followed their leaders in crowds. It was in
vain that laws, increasing in cruelty, condemned the men who
tried to flee from their native soil, to perpetual imprisonment
at the galleys, the women to seclusion for life, and both to
forfeiture of goods; it was in vain they sentenced those to
the same penalties, and shortly afterwards to death, who
gave them assistance; it was in vain that a part of the
victims’ spoils were promised to the informer. Emigration
spread from province to province, and foiled the despotism
of Louis.</p>

<p>We cannot in our times form any conception of such cruel
laws; for, in short, if the king would endure but one religion
in France, he ought at least to have sanctioned the departure
from the realm, of those who were not, or refused to be, of
it. This is so elementary a principle of natural justice, that
even the Spanish Inquisition and the League had always
permitted a choice between banishment and abjuration.
Louis XIV. by an unheard-of abuse of power, would not
permit it. He regarded his compromised <em>glory</em> alone, and
did not see that no one compromised it so much as he did
himself.</p>

<p>The language of these ordinances is as inconceivable as
their grounds. Words assumed a monstrous meaning. Thus,
we read that flight to foreign parts became “<em>criminal disobedience</em>,”
as if it were a crime to abandon everything rather
than deny one’s faith! Again, we read that the fugitives
were guilty of ingratitude for not having profited by the
permission to return to France, as if there had not been imposed
as the absolute condition of their return, the necessity
of rebelling against the God of their conscience. To such a
depth did Louis descend under the twofold prompting of his
pride and Father La Chaise!</p>

<p>Guards were placed at the entrance of the towns, at river-ferries,
in the ports, on the bridges, the highways, at every
avenue leading to the frontiers, and thousands of peasants
joined the troops posted from distance to distance, that they
might earn the reward promised to those who stopped the
fugitives. Everything failed. The emigrants purchased
passports, which were sold to them by the very secretaries of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
the governors, or by the clerks of the ministers of state.
They bought over the sentinels with money, giving as much
as six thousand and even eight thousand livres as the price
of escape. Some, more daring, fought their way across the
frontiers, sword in hand.</p>

<p>The majority marched at night, by remote and solitary
paths, concealing themselves in caverns during the day.
They had <em>itineraries</em> prepared expressly for this kind of
travelling. They went down precipices, or climbed mountain-heights,
and assumed all sorts of disguises. Shepherds, pilgrims,
soldiers, huntsmen, valets, merchants, mendicants:
they were always fugitives. Many, to avoid suspicion, pretended
to sell chaplets and rosaries.</p>

<p>The eyewitness Bénoit has given us a minute account:—“Women
of quality, even sixty and seventy years of age,
who had, so to speak, never placed a foot upon the ground
except to cross their apartments, or to stroll in an avenue,
travelled a hundred leagues to some village, which had been
indicated by a guide. Girls of fifteen, of every rank, exposed
themselves to the same hazard. They drew wheelbarrows,
they bore manure, panniers, and other burdens. They disfigured
their faces with dyes, to embrown their complexion,
with ointments or juices that blistered their skin, and gave
them a wrinkled aspect. Women and girls were seen to
counterfeit sickness, dumbness, and even insanity. Some
went disguised as men; and some, too delicate and small to
pass as grown men, donned the dress of lackeys, and followed
on foot, through the mud, a guide on horseback, who
assumed the character of a man of importance. Many of
these females reached Rotterdam in their borrowed garments,
and hastening to the foot of the pulpit, before they had time
to assume a more decent garb, published their repentance of
their compulsory signature.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The sea facilitated the evasion of a host of the Reformed.
They hid themselves in bales of merchandise, in casks, under
heaps of charcoal. They huddled together in holes in the
ship’s hold, and there were children who passed whole weeks
in these insupportable hiding-places without uttering a cry
that might betray them. Sometimes the peril of an open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
boat was hazarded without a mouthful of provisions, the preparation
of which might have prevented the flight of the
fugitives, who thus put to sea with only a little water or
snow, with which mothers moistened the lips of their
babes.</p>

<p>Thousands of emigrants perished of fatigue, cold, hunger,
or shipwreck, and by the bullets of the soldiery. Thousands
of others were captured, chained to murderers, dragged across
the kingdom to inspire their brethren with greater fear, and
were condemned to labour at the oar on board convict vessels.
The galleys of Marseilles were filled with these unfortunates,
among whom were ancient magistrates, officers, people of
gentle blood, and old men. The women were crowded into
the convents and the tower of Constance, at Aigues-Mortes.
But neither threats, nor dangers, nor executions, could
prevail against the energy and heroic perseverance of an
oppressed conscience.</p>

<p>The court became alarmed at the depopulation of the
country and the ruin of industry. It thought that it was
less a matter of faith that excited the French to flee from
France, than the attraction of danger, and one day it therefore
threw open all the outlets from the country. The next
day, finding that the emigration had only multiplied, it closed
them.</p>

<p>Touched by so great and so noble a misfortune, foreign
nations rivalled each other in the display of their sympathy
for the refugees. England, Switzerland, Holland, Prussia,
Denmark, Sweden, generously met their first wants, and it
never appeared more clearly, according to the remark of a
contemporary, that the fountain of charity is inexhaustible.
The more there was given, the more it seemed necessary
to give. Private individuals contended with their
governments in the distribution of relief. The fugitives
were received with open arms: they were furnished with
the means of work, with houses, and even churches; and
they repaid this liberal hospitality by the example of their
faith, a life of probity, and an industrious activity that enriched
their adopted countries. “The French Protestants
carried to England,” says Lemontey, “the secret and use of
the valuable machinery which has been the foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
her prodigious fortune, while the just complaint of these
exiles cemented the avenging league of Augsburg.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to fix the number of the refugees precisely.
The figures indicated by Vauban have been already noticed.
An intendant of Saintonge wrote, in 1698, that his province
had lost a hundred thousand Reformers. Languedoc had
lost from forty to fifty thousand before the war of the
Camisards,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and Guienne at least as many. The emigration
was proportion ably greater still in the Lyonnese and Dauphiny,
on account of their proximity to the frontiers. Whole
villages were abandoned, and many towns were half deserted.
Manufactories were closed by hundreds; certain branches of
industry entirely disappeared, and a vast extent of land went
altogether out of cultivation.</p>

<p>Voltaire says, that in the space of three years, nearly fifty
thousand families quitted the kingdom, and were followed
by hosts of others. A pastor of the wilderness, Antoine
Court, estimates the number at eight hundred thousand
persons. Sismondi reckons that if the lowest numbers be
taken, there remained in France somewhat more than a
million of Reformed, and that from three to four hundred
thousand established themselves in other countries. M.
Capefigue, a writer hostile to the Reformation, who consulted
the population tables of the general districts, calculates
the emigration at two hundred and twenty-five or two hundred
and thirty thousand souls, namely, one thousand five
hundred and eighty ministers, two thousand three hundred
elders, fifteen thousand gentlemen, and the remainder consisting
almost entirely of traders and artisans. It is worthy
of remark that the intendants made these returns in the first
years of the Revocation, and that they were interested in
showing the number of the emigrants to be as small as
possible, in order to avoid the reproach of negligence.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>It appears probable that from the years 1669 to 1760,
emigration, which was more than once renewed and suspended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
according to the alternatives of persecution and repose, drove
out of France, without counting those who returned at the
end of a few years, four or five hundred thousand persons,
who generally belonged to the most enlightened, the most
industrious, and the most moral portion of the nation.</p>

<p>Thirteen hundred refugees passed through Geneva in one
week. England formed eleven regiments of French volunteers,
and twenty-two French churches rose in London. An
entire suburb of that metropolis was peopled by refugees.
Holland won back by the emigration more than she had been
deprived of by the invasions of Louis XIV., and colonies of
Huguenots were founded even in North America, and at the
Cape of Good Hope. The name of these and their children
has survived everywhere with honour.</p>

<p>This emigration has been sometimes compared with that
of the year 1792; but the difference is much greater than
the resemblance. The emigrants of the Revolution had only
lost aristocratic privileges; the refugees of the Revocation
had been despoiled of their very means of religious and civil
existence. The first, at least those who emigrated at the
beginning, left their country, because they would not accept
the common law of equal rights; the latter, because they
were deprived of that common law. The emigration of
1792 was composed of only one class of individuals, who had
no other profession than that of arms; the emigration of
1685 comprised all the constituent elements of a people—merchants,
manufacturers, mechanics, labourers. Moreover,
the refugees founded numerous and useful establishments, of
which many yet still remain, while the later emigrants have
nowhere left enduring traces of their passage.</p>

<p>It is equally difficult to calculate the number of emigrants,
who perished in the attempts to escape, in party fights, in
prison, on the scaffold, and at the galleys, from the Edict of
Revocation to the Edict of Toleration of Louis XVI. Sismondi
thinks that the number of those who perished is
equal to that of the emigrants; that is to say, according
to his calculations, three or four hundred thousand. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
amount would seem to be too high. Yet Boulainvillers assures
us that, under the intendancy of Lamoignon de Bâville, in
the single province of Languedoc, a hundred thousand persons
fell victims to a premature death, and that a tenth
perished by fire, strangulation, or the wheel. Probably a
hundred thousand should be added for the rest of the kingdom
in the eighteenth century. Thus two hundred thousand
Frenchmen were sacrificed after an edict of pacification,
which had lasted nearly ninety years! Such were the new
and bloody hecatombs, that were immolated upon the altars
of intolerance!</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_II">II.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Protestants—we may now employ this name, as its
use became general even in ecclesiastical documents—the
Protestants, who had remained in the kingdom, were still
the prey of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>, after the Edict of Revocation,
each time they endeavoured to raise themselves. Those of
the principality of Orange and the Messin country, who had
hoped to find in their privileged position a guarantee against
violence, were compelled to submit to that [which had
been inflicted upon others]. The Lutherans of Alsace alone
were spared, on account of their numbers and the recent
diplomatic conventions, which protected them.</p>

<p>At Paris, some little moderation was observed, for fear of
disturbing, as we have already remarked, the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> and the
repose of Louis. Nevertheless, four days after the Revocation,
the place of worship at Charenton was demolished to
the last stone, and the members of the flock were ordered to
join the religion of the king without delay.</p>

<p>As they showed no alacrity in obeying, the principal elders
were imprisoned by means of <i lang="fr">lettres de cachet</i>. Next, the
Marquis de Seignelay summoned a hundred of the Notables
to his mansion, and desired them, in the presence of the
procurator-general and the lieutenant of police La Reynie,
immediately to sign an act of union. On several exclaiming
against this brutal conduct, the doors were immediately shut,
and they were told with vehement threats that they would
not be permitted to return until they had signed—an unworthy
ambush, an act of violence and extortion more characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
of a bandit of Calabria, than of a secretary of
state, and the grandson of the great Colbert.</p>

<p>All the Protestants of France were required, according to
the terms of the edict, to send their children to (Roman)
Catholic schools, and to have them taught the (Roman)
Catholic catechism. A new ordinance directed that the
children, from five to six years old, of those who were suspected
of still adhering to the Reformed religion, should be
taken away from them and confided to (Roman) Catholic
relations, or be placed elsewhere. But this measure overstepped
the possibility of execution. There were not sufficient
colleges, convents, or hospitals in France to hold so
many victims. The administrators of the laws were obliged
to confine themselves to the children of the rich, who could
afford to pay an alimentary pension, and in particular to
girls of tender age. This detestable kidnapping continued
during a great part of the century, and many families still
preserve a painful remembrance of the losses they experienced
by such abductions.</p>

<p>War was declared against books as well as individuals.
The district commanders received orders to visit the houses
of the Reformed with the index of the archbishop of Paris,
already mentioned, and to seize all suspected writings.
These domiciliary visits, which were repeated at intervals,
have destroyed to the very last copy, a great number of previous
works. The Bible even, was especially confiscated
and burned with implacable hatred.</p>

<p>The priests were not able to give regular instruction to this
multitude of pretended converts. Capuchin friars and the
like were employed, who were gross, impudent, unlettered,
and, in many cases, most immoral men. They filled the
Protestants with disgust and contempt. Children stopped
their mouths with their objections, and persons of mature
age imbibed a deeper aversion for a church that employed
ministers of such a character.</p>

<p>Recourse was had to new measures of rigour to drag from
the reluctant acts of Catholicity. The curates made a roll-call
of “<em>the re-united brethren</em>” who were placed upon benches
apart from the true Catholics; and those who were so unfortunate
as not to be present at the service, or the communion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
were exposed to severe punishment. The military supported
this inquisition to the utmost, and some intendants, who were
desirous of avoiding restitution of the property of which the
Reformers had been deprived, established an inspector in
each parish, whose business it was to examine whether the
new converts went regularly to mass, how they behaved
there, whether they attended the Paschal communion, and
faithfully observed the commandments of the Church. The
<i lang="fr">régime</i>, in fine, of the ninth and tenth centuries was restored,
and Frenchmen were treated in the same manner as the
savages of Paraguay had been by the Jesuits. The king perceived
that matters had been carried too far, and secretly
wrote to the intendants not to interfere any further to such
an extent in the transactions of private life.</p>

<p>In spite of the rigour of the laws, and in some manner
owing to that very rigour, Protestants reappeared on all sides.
Full of horror with respect to (Roman) Catholicism, they
had feigned to embrace it under the sabres of the dragoons,
and cursing the law which, by an infamous sacrilege, compelled
them to receive the communion in the Church of
Rome, although they did not believe in its dogmas,—shame,
remorse, the desire of expiating the error they had committed,
all served to reanimate their energy. They held
meetings in the wilds, on the summit of mountains, in deep
ravines, and vowed, in the name of God, to live and die in
the Reformed faith.</p>

<p>This opposition particularly manifested itself in Lower
Languedoc, Vivarais, and Cevennes, which abounded in retreats
almost inaccessible to the soldier. The principal events
of our history are henceforth concentrated in those provinces.
At the commencement of the French Reformation, the provinces
around Paris took the first rank. Then came the
turn of Béarn, Poitou, Guienne, and Saintonge. Next the
Reformation was apparent only in the mountain-heights of
Languedoc. The other provinces of the south followed the
movement, but at a later period and with less lustre. The
centre, the west, and the north long confined themselves to
the silence of domestic worship.</p>

<p>It will be observed also that the meetings of the Protestants
at the end of the seventeenth century, and the opening
of the eighteenth, presented a striking feature of resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
to those of the first days of Farel and Calvin; for they comprised
scarcely any but the poor, and people of low degree.
The peasantry of Cevennes united with the artisans of
Meaux; but the nobles, and the rich inhabitants, had abjured,
or sought an asylum in foreign lands, and nearly all
those who had neither fallen nor fled, secluded themselves
from the rest. From 1559 to 1685 the French Reformation
reckoned great families, who perhaps brought with them less
religious vitality than political passions; after the Revocation,
it again recruited itself from the popular masses, and
gathered there a strength, a devotion, and a constancy, to
which it had for some time been a stranger.</p>

<p>Upon the news of these meetings, some of the pastors
returned to France; and as they were not numerous enough
for the task, they took assistants with them, who received
the name of <em>preachers</em>. These were labourers, workmen, and
shepherds, who without other preparation than their fervid
zeal, rose in the meetings, and addressed pious exhortations
to the audience, out of the abundance of their hearts. Some
disorder of belief and conduct flowed from this, of which we
shall have to speak.</p>

<p>Learning that the pretended converts were again beginning
to celebrate their worship, the anger of the king, of
his ministers, and of the Jesuits, was kindled to an excess of
fury that knew no bounds. It was a phrenzy. The punishment
of death was pronounced, in the month of July, 1686,
against the pastors who had returned to France; the infliction
of perpetual confinement in the galleys, against those
who afforded them help, an asylum, or assistance of any kind;
a reward of five thousand five hundred livres was promised
to whoever should take a minister, or cause him to be taken;
lastly, the punishment of death was pronounced against
those who were discovered at a meeting. One is tempted to
ask if such laws could have issued from the polished court of
Louis XIV., that would have disgraced a race of cannibals.</p>

<p>On all sides the soldiers flew to the occupation of tracking
the Reformers. It was, according to Voltaire’s expression,
“a hunt in a great enclosure.” The Marquis de la Trousse,
nephew of Madame de Sévigné, who commanded in Cevennes,
scoured and beat the country continually with his troops.
When he heard the Protestants praying, or chanting psalms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
he made his soldiers fire upon them, as if they were wild
beasts. Yet these poor people were unarmed; they did not
defend themselves; and if they could not escape by flight,
they awaited death upon their knees, raising their hands to
heaven, or embracing each other. The veracious and honest
pastor, Antoine Court, says that “he was furnished with an
exact list of the meetings massacred in different places, and
that there were encounters in which three or four hundred
persons, old men, women, and children, remained dead on
the spot.”</p>

<p>In the times of the Albigenses, or of the slaughters of
Mérindol, an end would have been put to these meetings by
an universal butchery, in which not even the infant at the
domestic hearth would have been spared.</p>

<p>In the time of Louis XIV. manners had already become
less barbarous than the laws; the arm of the smiter was
partially arrested, and after sanguinary effusions, compelled
to stay.</p>

<p>This was not the only retrograde step. When the Reformers
were on their death-bed, fearing no longer the punishments
of men, and awaiting the judgment of God, they
refused to receive the sacraments of the [Roman Catholic]
church. The result of this was [the promulgation of] a fresh
law, not less atrocious than the preceding, but which it was
impossible to carry into execution for any great length of
time. Perpetual confinement at the galleys, or imprisonment
for life, with confiscation of property, was decreed
against the sick, who should recover after having rejected the
<i lang="la">viaticum</i>; and against those who should die, in the same
refusal, vengeance upon their corpses, which were doomed
to be drawn upon hurdles, and then flung into the common
sewers.</p>

<p>Rulhières says that to obtain the signature of Louis to
this law, he was persuaded that it was simply one of commination.
However, it was applied in some places by the
priests and the dregs of the populace, and the soil of France
was polluted by these hideous sights.</p>

<p>Some moribund Protestants themselves caused the priests
to be summoned to their bedside, in order that they might
declare their rejection of the sacraments of the Church, because
they saw in this an act of reparation before God and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
man. Then their corpses, or their mangled members, were
dragged through the streets along the gutters, amidst the
execrations of a drunken mob; so horrible was such a spectacle
at Calais, that an executioner fled to avoid participating
in it, and nothing but the fear of death could induce him to
return. Elsewhere, the Protestants themselves were forced
to drag the bodies of their brethren. When one of them
fell fainting to the ground, and was killed by the soldiers,
he was thrown upon the same hurdle. Guards were placed
about the corpses to prevent their being carried off by
relations and buried in secret.</p>

<p>This was outstepping anew the limit of possibility in the
reign of Louis XIV. All respectable people, (Roman)
Catholics as well as Reformed, raised a shout of horror; and
although the law was not formally repealed, the intendants
were ordered not to execute it except in extreme cases. The
secretary of state for ecclesiastical affairs wrote to them, on
the 6th of February, 1687, that his majesty released them
in some degree from the execution of this ordinance.
“With regard to those,” he said, “who, when dying, make
similar declarations (the refusal of the sacraments) through
a mere motive of obstinacy, and whose relations disapprove
of such rejection, it will be well not to raise the question
and not to prosecute. Therefore, his majesty thinks fit that
you should inform the ecclesiastics that they are, on these
occasions, enjoined not to summon so readily judges as witnesses,
in order that it may not be necessary to execute the
declaration in its fullest extent.” This applied to the curates,
who, <i lang="la">viaticum</i> in hand, went to the houses of the heretics,
escorted by judges and ushers, in order to inflame the passions
of the populace.</p>

<p>Thus difficulties sprang up at the very moment when it
was expected that they had all been overcome. There was
only one course to take, since it was no longer possible to
butcher a million of Frenchmen: this was to retrace the
steps that had been taken; but the court had not the courage
to do this, in spite of the advice of Vauban, who, from the
year 1686, had dared to pronounce the word <em>retractation</em>, and
it floated between the impossibility of overcoming and the
shame of acknowledging its error.</p>

<p>The prisons were overflowed; the galleys choked; and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
there were no means of lodging so many convicts, a great
number were transported to America, where they nearly all
miserably perished. Among those who remained in the
convict vessels, or were condemned to capital punishment,
many displayed great examples of fidelity and resolution.
Jurieu enumerated these instances in his <cite>Pastoral Letters</cite>,
published every fortnight, immediately after the Revocation.
We will extract only one or two.</p>

<p>A retired captain of the merchant service, Elie Neau,
had been sent to the hulks of Marseilles for having attempted
to fly his country. There he became a missionary
and preacher. He exhorted his brethren, consoled them,
and set them an example of patience and virtue. “I do
not,” he wrote to his pastor, a refugee in Holland, “I do not
wish any evil to those who have placed me in fetters. On
the contrary, while they thought they did me harm, they
have in reality done me much good; for I understand now
that true freedom consists in being liberated from sin.”</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholic almoner, seeing that he strengthened
his companions in misery, styled him a plague-spot and a
poisoner, and even protested that he would not say mass
while this man remained on the galley. Elie Neau was
therefore shut up in a dungeon of the citadel in 1694.</p>

<p>He remained there for several years, deprived of light, air,
and frequently of food, covered with a sack, a convict cap
placed upon his head, and deprived of all books, even (Roman)
Catholic books, and yet he wrote to his pastor: “If
I told you that in place of the sun, the light of nature, the
sun of grace shines with its divine rays in our hearts (he
had two companions in his dungeon)!... It is true
that we have many sad moments, which are terrible to the
flesh; but God is always near, to impose silence upon us,
and to soften the bitterness by His infinite goodness.”</p>

<p>Elie Neau was restored to liberty with other victims of
the Protestant faith, through the intervention of the king of
England. It will be remembered that France had already
suffered a like disgrace in the reign of Henry II.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The preachers and the pastors were doomed to certain
death. There was no chance of pardon or pity for them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
The first who was led to the gallows was a young man of
Nismes, named Fulcran Rey. He had just completed
his theological studies, and had not yet received pastoral
ordination. He began, however, to preach, “convinced,”
says Jurieu, “that when the house is on fire, it is the duty
of every one to aid in extinguishing the flames.” Rey had
taken the precaution to write a farewell letter to his father,
knowing that he would not long escape the persecutors. He
was, in effect, sold by some wretch, and arrested in the town
of Anduze.</p>

<p>Promises and threats were simultaneously used to induce
him to change his religion. The priests, the judges, and the
intendants, held out to him the most signal favours if he
would abjure, and a frightful death if he refused. His
steadfastness was unbroken; Rey had welcomed martyrdom
beforehand. He only asked one thing, and that was that
he might not see his father and mother, the sight of whom
he feared would unnerve him.</p>

<p>When the sentence was read to him that condemned him
to be hanged, after the torture, he said, “I am treated more
mildly than my Saviour, by being sentenced to so mild a
death. I had prepared myself to be broken upon the wheel
or burned.” Then raising his eyes to heaven, he thanked
the Almighty.</p>

<p>On his way to the gallows, he met many who had abjured,
and seeing them bathed in tears, he addressed fraternal exhortations
to them. He would also have confessed his faith
from the scaffold: “But a sermon,” says Jurieu, “from such
a pulpit and by such a preacher, was too formidable, and
a number of drummers had been placed round the gibbet,
who were ordered to commence beating their drums all
together.” Fulcran Rey perished at Beaucaire, the 7th of
July, 1686, at the age of twenty-four years.</p>

<p>Astonishing vicissitude of human affairs! Who would
have said to Louis XIV. that the grandson of his child, a king
of France, would also have his voice drowned by drummers
in like manner around his scaffold? O princes, be mindful
how you accustom your subjects to the sight of sanguinary
executions! You are but men yourselves, and the day of
misfortune may overtake you likewise!</p>

<p>Claude Brousson was the most renowned of the martyrs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
of this era, and has left the deepest traces of admiration and
commiseration in the memory of the Protestant people. He
was born at Nismes in 1647, and practised at the bar of
Castres and Toulouse. So long as he could defend the cause
of the oppressed churches before the tribunal, he was desirous
of no other avocation; but when he was no longer permitted
to plead, he devoted his oratorical powers to preaching. He
had been offered in vain the place of a counsellor of Parliament,
if he would change his religion; but the conscience of
Claude Brousson was one of those that could not be bought.</p>

<p>He was ordained to the ministry at Cevennes, amidst the
sound of grape-shot, that spread death amongst the ranks of
his brethren; and thenceforth, with no other shelter than
savage rocks, the woods, or some isolated hut, he unceasingly
preached the word of the Gospel. When he was too closely
surrounded, he quitted France; but he afterwards returned,
at the call of his soul and the wailings of the people. His
wife and friends constantly besought him not to hazard his
life, but they could not restrain him.</p>

<p>In 1693 a price was set upon his head, and five hundred
livres were promised to whoever should deliver him up dead
or alive. Brousson’s only reply to this atrocious proclamation
was a calm and simple apology, addressed to the intendant
of the province.</p>

<p>His sermons, which appeared at Amsterdam, in 1695,
under the title of <cite>The Mystic Manna of the Desert</cite>, are
replete with the same feeling. It might be expected that
discourses composed under a forest oak, or upon the rock beside
a torrent, by one proscribed, and pronounced in meetings
that ofttimes terminated in fearful massacres, would be impressed
with a dark and vehement exaggerated. Yet there is
nothing of this in the <cite>Mystic Manna</cite>. The language of this
preacher was more moderate and more gladsome than that
of Saurin in the peaceful church of the Hague; he only saw
in persecution the hand of God, and his words were only
burning when he censured his hearers.</p>

<p>Claude Brousson was at length captured at Oléron, in
Béarn, in the year 1698, and transferred to Montpellier. He
might have escaped at the passage of the canal of Languedoc;
but believing that his hour was come, he did not. In
his interrogatory he accepted, without any opposition, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
accusations respecting his exercising the ministerial office,
but he denied in the most energetic terms a reproach which
was absolutely false, that he had ever conspired to introduce
Marshal Schomberg into France at the head of a foreign
army.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November he was led to the scaffold,
and his voice was stifled by the rolling of eighteen drums.
“I have executed more than two hundred condemned,” said
the hangman some days after, “but no one made me
tremble so much as M. Brousson. When he was put to the
torture, the commissioner and the judges turned pale and
trembled more than he did, who raising his eyes, prayed to
God. I would have fled, had I been able, rather than
have put so honest a man to death. If I dared speak, I
could say many things about him; certainly, he died like a
saint.”</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_III">III.</h3>
</div>


<p>Generous protestations were speedily raised as soon as it
became generally known what evils had followed upon the
Revocation of the edict, and to what extremities the council
was reduced in order to maintain the delusive fiction of
the unity of faith in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Jansenists must be first mentioned. They declared
that their blood curdled at the thought of the sacrilegious
communions forced upon the heretics, and rejected as a
monstrous offence against the Deity himself, a proselytism
only successful under the terror of dragoons, the galleys,
and gibbets.</p>

<p>The bishops of Grenoble and Saint-Pons deserve an honourable
mention. The former addressed a letter condemnatory
of the forced communions to the curates of his diocese. The
latter wrote to the commander of the troops, that all compulsion
in such a matter was impious. “It is,” he said, “veritable
sacrilege. And it could be wished that the unhappy
wretches who are guilty of these abominations, and the
ministers of the altar who are the instruments of them, were
cast into the sea, according to the words of the Scripture,
with a millstone about their necks; for they not only confirm
the Huguenots in their unbelief, but they also shake the
thereby wavering faith of the Catholics.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<p>Many honest and pious curates, moreover, refused to discharge
the office of informers, and to torture until the actual
moment of death, the souls that declined their ministry.
But the Jesuits and the great body of the clergy persisted
in urging and employing measures of severity. Fénélon
wrote from Saintonge in 1686, “The Jesuits here are a set
of obstinates, who have no other words for the Protestants
than fines and imprisonment in this world, and the devil
and hell in the next. We have had infinite trouble to stop
these good fathers from bursting into violent exclamations
against our mildness.”</p>

<p>It is at first sight a singular thing, to see on one side the
Jesuits so notorious for their equivocal piety, for their accommodative
morality, the inventors of <em>easy devotion</em>, soliciting
the most violent measures against the Protestants; and,
on the other side, the Jansenists, so rigid in their articles of
faith, and so austere in their practice, insisting upon a moderate
course. But surprise ceases when we reflect that the
former sought only for power, the latter were chiefly solicitous
for sincerity. The first were contented with (Roman)
Catholics of any kind, provided they bent their necks to the
yoke of the Church; the second wanted none but true
Catholics, and would not take them at the hands of soldiers
and hangmen.</p>

<p>The nomination of M. de Noailles (afterwards a cardinal),
to the see of Paris, gave some strength to the Jansenist
party, who had never been completely banished from the
court or the councils. The archbishop presented a memorial to
the king, in which he exhorted him to adopt measures more
conformable with Christianity. He was seconded by many
persons of importance, who had studied the political side of
the question with attention. The superintendent Pontchartrain
regretted the loss of so many artisans and industrious
citizens. The Marquis d’Aguesseau, the Duke de Beauvilliers,
the Marquis de Pompone, and the Marshal Catinat,
avowed the same opinions. They were above all struck with
the progress of public poverty. They saw with affright that
the force of destruction had at that epoch infinitely surpassed
the power of production, and that the finances of the
state were in a deplorable condition.</p>

<p>Vauban wrote the following lines to Louvois, which prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
that the Revocation was not so popular with the enlightened
classes as was pretended. “The forced conversions have
inspired a general horror of the conduct of the ecclesiastics.
If it is to be pursued, the necessity arises of exterminating
the pretended new converts as rebels, or of banishing them
as relapsed, or of confining them as madmen;—execrable
projects, contrary to all the Christian virtues, moral and
civil!”</p>

<p>Even the timid Racine himself raised his voice, in the
tragedy of Esther, represented in 1689. “The choice of the
subject,” says one of the commentators of this great poet,
“permitted the strongest allusions. At the very moment
when the Protestants were persecuted, the poet dared to
make known the true maxims of the Gospel. He defended
the oppressed in the presence of the royal oppressor. Lastly,
he painted Louvois in the most odious light; and that there
might be no possibility of his not being recognised, he put
in the mouth of Haman the very words which had escaped
from the minister in the delirium of his pride.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Fénélon prepared a memoir of remarkable boldness for
the perusal of Louis XIV. This composition, which was
for a long time unknown, was first published in 1825. In it
the archbishop of Cambray represents Father La Chaise as
a man of a gross and limited mind, afraid of sound virtue,
loving only profane and libertine people, nourishing the
king’s ignorance, and as <em>a blind man leading another</em>. He
reproaches Louis himself in terms more severe than any we
have used towards him in this history: “You do not love
God,” Fénélon thus addresses him; “you only fear Him with
the fear of a slave; it is hell, and not God, whom you dread.
Your religion only consists of superstition, and petty superficial
practices. You are scrupulous about trifles, and callous
with regard to terrible evils. You care for nought but your
own glory and pleasure. You centre everything in yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
as if you were the God of the earth, and all the rest
had been created only to be sacrificed to you!”</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon, having quarrelled with Father
La Chaise, and being, moreover, no longer anxious about her
future [condition], also seemed to side with the Archbishop
de Noailles, Fénélon, and the Jansenists. She wrote [to this
effect] to one of her relations: “You have been converted;
do not meddle with the conversion of others. I avow to
you that I do not wish to be responsible to God nor the
king for all these conversions.”</p>

<p>But the unbounded pride of Louis XIV., which revolted
from the idea of confessing to his people and Europe that
he had been mistaken, the remembrance of the praises that
had been bestowed upon him for this measure, the influence
of Father La Chaise, who treated as prevarication every
project of milder proceedings, and the negative answers of
the majority of the bishops to M. de Noaille’s letter of consultation,
as to the steps it would be advisable to take,—all
prevented the plan of the Jansenists from succeeding.</p>

<p>These laborious negotiations only elicited the Edict of the
13th of April, 1698, which solemnly confirmed the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. Not one of the laws of torture
and blood was abolished: only it was commanded that
new means should be employed for the better instruction of
the united subjects.</p>

<p>The conduct of the governors and the intendants was not
changed in the least by it. They acted towards the Reformers
like proconsuls, possessed of the enormous privilege of imprisoning,
condemning to the galleys, dragging to the scaffold,
shooting, abducting children, and confiscating property, without
a single judicial form. Intolerance had subjected the
Protestant population to the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of Turkey.</p>

<p>Of all these intendants, the most notorious was Lamoignon
de Bâville, who for thirty-three years had been the supreme
administrator, or, as he was called, the King of Languedoc.
His motto was: “<em>Ever ready, never hurried.</em>” He was a
calm, methodical, hard man, without a passion but that of
power, coolly ordering the most frightful executions, hanging,
beheading, quartering sixty or eighty persons at a time,
devastating whole cantons, burning towns and villages, not
out of religious zeal, but for state reasons. His character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
was a compound of Louis XI., Richelieu, and Robespierre,
and he would subordinate to his policy the sufferings, tortures,
and murder of a whole people without compunction.
Bâville was, indeed, to use the phrase of a contemporary,
“the terror and the horror of Languedoc.”</p>

<p>He did not approve of the Revocation; but from the moment
it was pronounced, his advice was to carry it into extreme
execution against the obstinate. “It is requisite, in order
to insure the tranquillity of the state,” he wrote, “to change
their will, to regulate ourselves upon what we have already
done, to reduce them to a full submission, by tearing the
prejudices of birth from their hearts, and by compelling
them, authoritatively, to adopt the religion of the state.” It
was of little importance to him whether the religion were
false or true, accepted or rejected by the conscience of the
new converts; it was the <em>religion of the state</em>, and submission
must be made thereto. “<em>Let them be damned, provided they
obey</em>,” was the saying of a military commander of the same
epoch. Supreme and vilest expression of the moral degradation
of being a persecutor without being even a fanatic!</p>

<p>This ferocious proconsul was exasperated at the obstinacy
of the Protestants in holding their meetings. He surrounded
them with troops, and charged them with the
bayonet and the sword. The most notable of the prisoners
were hanged upon the first trees, the others were sent to the
galleys, and there were numbered, at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, two thousand of these unfortunate convicts,
who were worse treated than highway robbers.</p>

<p>The priests of these parts, receiving nothing but marks
of aversion and contempt from those whom they regarded as
their flocks, partook, for the most part, of Bâville’s anger,
and helped him to assuage it. They spied out the delinquents,
denounced them to the authorities, put themselves
at the head of the soldiers, and displayed all the more barbarity,
in that it was not in their calling to be cruel.</p>

<p>The most bloodthirsty of all was one Chayla, an inspector
of missions, and arch-priest. He had turned his presbytery
into a stronghold, or a cavern of bandits, and seemed to feel
an exquisite delight in the torments of his victims. “Sometimes,”
says Count de Gébelin, “he tore out their beards or
their eyebrows with pincers, sometimes he put hot coals into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
their hands, which were then forcibly clenched, so long as
the coals could burn; sometimes he enveloped their fingers
with cotton steeped in oil or tallow, and then setting fire to
it, would sear their hands until they cracked, or were consumed
to the bone.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Having arrested a band of fugitives, and shut them up in
pens like animals, among whom were two ladies, related to
the most important families of the country, a band of forty
or fifty determined men presented themselves before the door
of his house at Pont-de-Montvert, singing a psalm. These
avengers of blood first broke open the dungeons, and
delivered the prisoners, whose swollen bodies and fractured
limbs were scarcely able to bear the motion that restored
them to liberty.</p>

<p>The Abbé du Chayla ordered his servants to repel these
persons with fire-arms, and one of the assailants fell. The
others set fire to the presbytery, seized the arch-priest, made
him gaze upon his victims, their mangled limbs and lacerated
bodies, and then all, after this frightful act of accusation,
stabbed him with their weapons. He received fifty-two
wounds. Such was the beginning of the war of the Camisards.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_IV">IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>This last struggle of the French Reformation bears no
comparison with any that preceded it. Admiral Coligny and
Henry of Navarre were backed by entire provinces, and
half the nobility of the kingdom. The Duke de Rohan
also was a redoubtable chief, and a skilful leader, who with
his followers fought pitched battles. In this instance there
were only poor peasants, without weapons but those which
they wrenched from [the hands of] their enemies, ignorant
of the art of war, and reduced to sell their lives dearly,
behind the copses and rocks of their mountains. They were
led on by no nobles; they were not even supported by the
Reformed <i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> of the plains and towns; this time it
was the meanest of the people who spilled their blood, and
died around the standard on which they had inscribed:
“Freedom of religion!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span></p>

<p>The Camisards were led by men, whom they regarded as
inspired, or prophets. A new convert, half abbé, half playwright,
who curiously mingled comedy with controversy,—Bruyëis,
has attacked these prophets with irony and gall in
his <cite>History of Fanaticism</cite>. Other (Roman) Catholic writers
have followed him. Even the Bishop Fléchier pursues the
prophets of Languedoc with his cold and harsh antitheses.</p>

<p>Rulhières was more just: he had the good faith to accuse
the persecutors <ins class="corr" id="tn-355" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'of the Cévenols'">
of the Cévenoles</ins> of these mental aberrations.
“Can we forget then,” he asks, “that their places of worship
had been cast down; their country delivered up to military
pillage; their children carried off; the houses of those
styled obstinate, razed; that the most zealous of their pastors
had been broken upon the wheel, while no one had instructed
them in our religion?”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Such, in effect, were the causes of these wild ecstasies, or
inspirations—the want of spiritual leaders and of schools,
spoliations, sufferings, threatened executions, the continual
fear of the hulks and the gibbet. The minds of these unfortunates
became excited; and finding no support on earth,
they easily believed that they had supernatural communications
from on high.</p>

<p>This religious exaltation began in the province of Vivarais,
from the time of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i> and the Revocation [of the
Edict of Nantes]. The fourth pastoral letter of Jurieu,
dated the 15th of October, 1686, mentions that a man
belonging to Codognan, imagined that he had seen a vision
and heard a voice, which said to him, “Go, and console my
people.” In Béarn and elsewhere, simple people fancied they
had heard the singing of psalms in the air, and had witnessed
miraculous apparitions.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Isabeau Vincent appeared, <em>the Shepherdess
of Dauphiny</em>, a young girl of sixteen or seventeen years
of age, who could neither read nor write. She had ecstasies.
“For the first five weeks,” says Jurieu, “she spoke during her
ecstasies no language but that of her country, because her
only auditors were the peasantry of her village. The noise
of this miracle having spread, people came to see her who
understood and spoke French. She then began to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
French, and with a diction as correct as if she had been
brought up in the first houses of Paris. She composed
admirable and excellent prayers. Her action had no violence.
Her lips moved slightly, and without the least appearance
of convulsion.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>It was then as if a moral contagion had spread over the
whole of Vivarais and Languedoc. Prophets were counted
by hundreds. They were people of the lower classes, who
had read nothing but the Bible; they quoted passage after
passage, which they continually applied on every occasion.
They particularly invoked the texts of the books of prophecies
in the Old Testament and Apocrypha. Even children
felt these inspirations, and persisted in them, notwithstanding
the severe corrections of their parents, who were held
responsible for these strange phenomena.</p>

<p>This ecstasy had four degrees: the calling, the inspiration,
the prophecy, and the gift, or the inspiration in its highest
degree. It cannot be doubted that the ecstasies were sincere.
They were the first to believe in the spirit, which they said
filled them, and obeyed it without reservation, hesitation, or
delay, although they went to a certain death.</p>

<p>This spirit, they would say, made them better people.
“The persons, who had received the inspiration,” they said,
“directly abandoned every kind of licentiousness and vanity.
Some who had led a debauched life, first became steady and
pious, and every one who frequented their society also
became better-behaved, and led an exemplary life. This
spirit begot in us a horror of idolatry, a contempt for the
world, charity, internal consolation, hope, and an unleavened
joy of heart.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The Camisard chiefs were designated by the spirit. They
believed themselves to be filled with it, and this was the
source of their courage, their triumphs, and their constancy
in the greatest extremities. Whether the necessity of the
moment was to collect their scattered bands, to fix the point
of attack, to choose the day of combat, to retreat, to advance,
to discover traitors and spies, to spare prisoners, or to put
them to death, it was the spirit they consulted: everywhere
and in all things their persuasion was that they acted under
the immediate and sovereign direction of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span></p>

<p>One of these Camisards, Elie Marion, thus tells this with
great simplicity in his <cite lang="fr">Théâtre Sacré des Cevennes</cite>: “We
were without strength and without counsel, but our inspirations
were our succour and our support. They elected our
leaders, and conducted them; they were our military discipline.
It is they who raised us, even weakness itself, to
put a strong bridle upon an army of more than twenty
thousand picked soldiers. It is they who banished sorrow
from our hearts in the midst of the greatest peril, as well as
in the deserts and the mountain fastnesses, when cold and
famine oppressed us. Our heaviest crosses were but lightsome
burdens, for this intimate communion that God allowed
us to have with Him, bore up and consoled us; it was our
safety and our happiness.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Upon what does the judgment of enlightened, as well as
of ignorant men depend? These inspirations, those inner
voices recall, trait for trait, the language and the history of
Joan of Arc. The religious phenomenon is absolutely the
same. But the Maid of Orleans delivered France, and the
people of Cevennes were vanquished. The first has been
almost worshipped: the others have been for the most part
treated as madmen and fanatics. If the English had
triumphed in the fifteenth century, the shepherdess of
Vaucouleurs would also have been regarded by historians as
a poor peasant girl, crazed by silly delusions!</p>

<p>Roland and Cavalier were the two principal leaders of the
Cévenoles: the former, more resolute, firm, and inaccessible
to seduction, remained to the very last sword in hand, and
was the true type of the Camisards, although he has obtained
less celebrity; the latter was more skilful, adventurous, and
brilliant, brave amongst the brave, [no less than] an epic
hero. Both trusted, like Oliver Cromwell, in the authority
of inspiration, and never were military commanders better
obeyed.</p>

<p>The soldiers called themselves children of God, people of
God, the flock of the Lord, and bestowed upon their chieftains
the names of brother Roland, brother Cavalier. Thus was
equality and fraternity joined to the most rigorous discipline.</p>

<p>They made stern and bloody reprisals upon their persecutors,
the priests and the soldiers; yet the spirit they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
consulted, habitually induced them to set their prisoners
free who had not injured them. They punished with the
utmost severity those of their number who were guilty of
unnecessary slaughter or acts of depredation. There was no
quarrelling, swearing, or drunkenness in their ranks. All
their provisions were held in common. They have been
accused by their enemies of having led a licentious life,
because they had women in their camp: these women were
the wives, mothers, and daughters of the Camisards, who
attended them to prepare their food and to tend the
wounded.</p>

<p>Their magazines and hospitals were caverns. They clothed
themselves with the spoils of the soldiers of the royal army,
and supplied themselves with balls from the church bells and
utensils of the presbyteries. They had no money except
such as was furnished them by villagers almost as poor as
themselves, or such as they picked up on the fields of battle;
but they needed it not.</p>

<p>Every band had its preacher, and like the Puritans of
England, they consecrated long hours to religious services.
“Although the camp was often in the week called to pray in
common, Sunday was the Lord’s day, appointed for public
assemblies and general prayer. Two days beforehand, the
prophets announced to the neighbouring townships the place
of meeting.... At break of day the people arrived, and
mingled with the children of God. A prophet ascended a
rock, which served instead of pulpit; a second preacher
followed, then a third, and from homily to homily, from
prayer to prayer, from canticle to canticle, the insatiable
multitude remained unwearied until evening insensibly crept
upon them. Then the people resumed the road to their
villages, and the Camisards that to their camp.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Their number never exceeded ten thousand. But they
maintained a secret intelligence with all the population of
the new converts. The herdsmen and labourers gave them
notice, by recognised signs, of the approach of the troops,
and when they were obliged to fly, the Camisards had secure
retreats. Theirs was a guerilla warfare, composed of surprises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
or encounters of a few hundreds of men on either side. When
they were victorious, they took advantage of their success,
to hold assemblies, at which all the Huguenots of the neighbourhood
attended; if they were overpowered, they fled to
the impenetrable gorges of the hills. They received the
first fire of their enemies on one knee, singing the sixty-eighth
Psalm: “<em>Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered</em>;”
then, precipitating themselves upon the foe, they fought with
all the fury of despair, aware that they would receive no
quarter or mercy, and preferring the death of the soldier to
the gallows or the wheel.</p>

<p>The war of the Camisards lasted from 1702 to 1704.
The Count de Broglie, brother-in-law of Bâville, and the
king’s lieutenant-general in Languedoc, ordered horrible devastations,
without succeeding in stifling the insurrection.
His want of success led to his recall in 1703, and the court
replaced him by the Marshal de Montrevel, a brave but
ignorant and presumptuous soldier, who also imagined that
he should put an end to the revolt by the terror of his
executions.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. was deceived concerning this war, as he had
been about the conversion of the Protestants. Those who
had promised that the Revocation would not cost a drop of
blood, were afraid to apprize him of the extent of the evil.
Montrevel was sent into Languedoc by a subterfuge, the
young Duke du Maine, who had been instructed beforehand,
having asked as a mark of honour, that a marshal of France
might command the troops in the province where he governed.
Madame de Maintenon said on this occasion: “It is useless
for the king to occupy himself with the details of this war;
this would not cure the evil, and would do him much harm.”
And a secretary of state wrote to the intendant of the province:
“Take care not to give this war the appearance of a
serious matter.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had arrived in Languedoc, the Marshal de
Montrevel published two ordinances, in which the penalty of
death was pronounced, not only against those who had
recourse to arms, but also against all persons, who gave the
Camisards food, or retreat, or any assistance whatever. He
announced that for every (Roman) Catholic killed, he would
hang two or three religionists, and that the villages of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
new converts, in which a priest or soldier perished, should be
immediately burned.</p>

<p>Massacres were now no longer counted. Gibbets, scaffolds,
even stakes were kept in permanent readiness. All
the suspected were arrested. Every population was put
under restraint. The parents of the rebels were carried off
for punishment, the notables of each place were kept as hostages,
the young people were confined lest they should fly to
swell the bands of the Camisards, and when the prisoners
were too numerous, the executioner was put in play to thin
them.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholics were invited to take refuge in the
towns, and the country was pitilessly laid waste, and as the
work of destruction did not make sufficient progress to satisfy
Montrevel, he caused the dwellings of the peasantry to be
burned. Thus the land, so flourishing before the Revocation,
became a vast and mournful desert.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, 1703, being Palm-Sunday, about three
hundred persons assembled in a mill near Nismes, for the
purpose of religious worship. Information of the meeting
having been given to Montrevel, he rose from table, and
hastening to the place of meeting with a troop of soldiers,
ordered the doors to be burst open and the slaughter of all
present; the slowness of the carnage irritated his impatience,
and he gave the mill to the flames. Every one perished;
not a single person escaped, excepting a young girl, who was
saved by the humanity of a lackey of the marshal. She was
hanged next day, and her liberator only escaped the same
fate through the earnest intercession of some nuns.</p>

<p>The Bishop Fléchier, relating this atrocious butchery, says,
with the utmost coolness: “This example was necessary to
arrest the pride of these folks.” Priests and nobles, you
complain of the executions of 1793, and with reason; but
you yourselves set the example, and the cruelties of the men
of the Reign of Terror have never surpassed yours!</p>

<p>As an auxiliary to the regular troops, Montrevel formed
companies of (Roman) Catholic volunteers, under the name
of Cadets of the Cross, or White Camisards, in contrast to
the Huguenots, who were called Black Camisards. These
new Crusaders were encouraged by a bull of Clement XI.,
who granted them a general and absolute remission of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
sins, on the condition of exterminating the heretics of
Cevennes, “<em>a cursed brood issuing from the execrable race of
Albigenses</em>.”</p>

<p>The Cadets of the Cross were soon dissolved by their own
party. They were rogues, who, rejecting all discipline and
not even respecting the Church whose defenders they styled
themselves, attacked indiscriminately (Roman) Catholics and
Huguenots, so that there was spoil to be obtained.</p>

<p>Far from triumphing by his system of terror, Montrevel
only increased the number of his opponents. The Cévenoles,
reduced to despair, with nothing left to lose, and as ill used
when they stayed at home as when they took arms, fled in
crowds to the ranks of the Camisards. The detachments of
Montrevel were defeated on every side, in the winter of
1703-1704, at Nayes, by the rocks of Aubais, at Martignargues,
at the bridge of Salindres; and the marshal was
recalled.</p>

<p>The war began to excite serious uneasiness at Versailles.
Holland and England had put themselves in communication
with the insurgents, and had promised to send them succours.
If a foreign fleet had appeared upon the shores of the southern
provinces, it might have decided a general rising of the religionists
of Languedoc, Vivarais, Dauphiny, and Guienne, and
might have thrown into the heart of the kingdom fifty thousand
combatants, and have struck a terrible blow at the
already sunken fortune of Louis XIV. The court comprehended
the danger, and the Marshal de Villars, who was
sent to replace Montrevel, received orders to try milder
means.</p>

<p>Some of the Camisard leaders, having encountered great
losses, showed a disposition, soon after the new commander’s
appointment, to enter into an arrangement. They required,
as the foremost condition, liberty of conscience and worship:
Villars answered this point with equivocal phrases. Protestant
historians affirm that the marshal accepted the condition;
the historians of the (Roman) Catholics, with Fléchier
at their head, deny it. It is difficult to unravel the truth
from such contradictory assertions.</p>

<p>This, however, is incontestable; during the negotiations
between the Duke de Villars and Cavalier, the Camisards
held public assemblies at Calvisson, singing psalms, praying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
and preaching, in the midst of an innumerable concourse of
Protestants.</p>

<p>The interview of the marshal with the once baker’s boy
took place in the garden of the Récolets monks, at the gates
of Nismes, on the 16th of May, 1704. “He is,” writes
Villars to the minister of war, “a peasant of the lowest
rank, not yet twenty-two years of age, and scarcely seeming
eighteen, small and with no imposing mien, but possessing
firmness and good sense that are altogether surprising. He
has great talent in arranging for the subsistence of his men,
and disposes his troops as well as the best-trained officers
could do it. From the moment Cavalier began to treat, up
to the conclusion, he has always acted in good faith.”</p>

<p>Cavalier received a colonel’s commission, and went to Versailles,
where finding a cold reception, and suspecting that
he was not safe, he entered into a foreign service. He died
governor of the island of Jersey, with the reputation of a
good general, and a worthy man.</p>

<p>The other leader of the Camisards, Roland, essayed to
prolong the struggle. To every proposition for an arrangement,
he replied: “I will not trust myself in the lion’s
mouth.” A traitor sold him to the intendant for a hundred
louis, and he fell after a desperate resistance. Some of his
lieutenants still endeavoured to reinflame the insurrection;
and until as late as 1715 daring partisans agitated Cevennes;
but their attempts, which were not without courage, had no
success.</p>

<p>Such was the termination of the Protestant La Vendée.
Its analogy with the (Roman) Catholic La Vendée is striking.
On both sides oppressed conscience, and religion trodden
underfoot, placed arms in the hands of the people.
Cathelineau, the driver, was the chief of the Vendéans, as
the baker’s boy, Cavalier, was of the Cévenoles. Marshal
de Villars and General Hoche could succeed in pacifying
either revolt by moderation alone. But the camp of the
Vendéans reckoned amongst its numbers the nobility and
clergy; the Camisards had with them neither gentlemen nor
pastors. The first maintained, without desiring it, the cause
of ancient privileges, together with the great principle of
religious freedom; the latter fought for their religion alone,
and their blood was not spilled in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span></p>

<p>The war of the Camisards, respecting which there may be
different opinions, which it is not our province to examine
here, had a double result; it reassured the Protestants, who
nearly all returned to their former faith, and it inspired the
court of Versailles with salutary apprehensions. The men, whom
justice and respect for conscience did not restrain, were
arrested by fear, during the remainder of the eighteenth century,
from pushing the intrepid mountaineers to extremities,
who had once risen from beneath the axe of the executioner.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_V">V.</h3>
</div>


<p>There cannot be a more painful subject for consideration
than the reign of Louis XIV. This aged king, nearly alone,
outliving all the great men of his era; the irreparable void
left in his court by the death of his children and his grandchildren;
an unhappy war, exposing the frontiers of his
kingdom to the enemy; three millions of debt; the people
overwhelmed with imposts which they could no longer pay;
commerce destroyed, industry extinguished, a part of the
country lying fallow; the monarch hated by the nation, of
which he had once been the idol, consuming his days in the
duties of a puerile etiquette, or of a devotion more puerile
still, and supporting with difficulty a royalty, whose splendour
and <i lang="fr">prestige</i>, were decaying with him. What an expiation
was this for his despotic and insatiable pride!</p>

<p>The quarrels of religion pursued him unceasingly, and left
him no repose. His court and council were divided upon the
controversies of Jansenism and Quietism. When he thought
he had appeased them on one side, they reappeared on the
other, and his death-bed was also troubled by the disputes of
theologians concerning the bull <i lang="la">Unigenitus</i>.</p>

<p>The Protestants were seldom, and then unwillingly, alluded
to before him, and he himself also avoided mentioning them.
[Their repression] was an undertaking that had failed, and
he sought a refuge in oblivion from his humiliating miscalculations.</p>

<p>The Reformed of Paris were treated more than ever with
caution, in order to spare the king painful reflections. The
celebrated lieutenant of police, Voyer-d’Argenson, expressly
recommended toleration. “The Inquisition, which is sought
to be established in Paris against the Protestants, whose conversion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
is very doubtful,” he said, in a memorial addressed to
the council, “would be attended with great difficulties. It
would force them to purchase certificates, either for money
or by sacrilege. It would drive away from this city those
who are born subjects of neutral princes, would alienate more
and more the unfriendly Protestants, blast the peace of
families, excite relations to become denouncers of each other,
and cause perhaps an universal murmur in the capital of the
kingdom.” The council took the hint, and declined to interfere
with the Protestants.</p>

<p>In the provinces everything depended more or less upon
the humour of the governors and intendants. Bâville
renewed from time to time his sanguinary expeditions,
although he had ceased to conceal from himself their impotency.
“There are districts of twenty and thirty parishes,”
he wrote, “where the curate is the most unhappy and the
most useless of all the inhabitants, and where, whatever care
may have been taken, not a single Catholic has been made,
nor even one established from without.”</p>

<p>The Protestants bore the burdens of the state, as soldiers,
sailors, and tax-payers, without enjoying any of the benefits
which should have belonged to all, of common right. The
gentlemen served in the army, where they were less scrupulous
than elsewhere about acts of Catholicity. The men of
the middle class applied themselves to agriculture and commerce;
and they prospered, in spite of the oppression of the
laws, through that spirit of individuality and activity which
so eminently distinguishes Protestantism. The Marquis
d’Aguesseau avowed this, when new measures of severity
were proposed against them in 1713. “By an unfortunate
fatality,” he said, “in nearly every kind of art, the most
skilful workmen, as well as the richest merchants, belong to
the pretended Reformed religion; it would therefore be very
dangerous to exact that they should become Catholics.”</p>

<p>Things would probably have been allowed to continue
under this semi-toleration, but that the Jesuit Letellier,
who had succeeded in 1709 to Father La Chaise in the
office of confessor to the king, would not permit it. “He
was,” says the Duke de Saint-Simon, “a man of hard and
obstinate temper, of incessant application, and of only one
idea—the triumph of his order and the overthrow of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
other school. His nature was cruel and ferocious; his personal
appearance no less unpromising; he would have excited
fear, if met with in a wood. His physiognomy was dark,
gloomy, false, and terrible, and his eyes were fierce, evil, and
extremely sinister: one was struck on seeing him.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Letellier extorted from the king, then verging on decrepitude
and death, the declaration of the 8th March, 1715.
The title alone of this law “<em>makes one’s blood curdle</em>,” to use
the expression of the Baron du Breteuil to Louis XVI. It is
as follows: “It shall be a law, that those who shall have
declared that they will persist and die in the pretended Reformed
religion, whether they have abjured or not, <em>shall be
reputed as having relapsed</em>.” It therefore acted upon the
monstrous fiction that there were no longer any Protestants
in France, and that there could never be any more! All
were held to be legally (Roman) Catholics, since the refusal
of the sacraments exposed them to suffer the frightful penalties
pronounced against those who relapsed! It is with
reason that Lamontey says in his book upon the monarchical
establishment of Louis XIV.: “The annals of the world
do not offer another example of a code wholly based upon
a lie.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The authors of this declaration relied upon the following
reason: “The sojourn that those who were of the pretended
Reformed religion, or who have been born of Calvinist
<ins class="corr" id="tn-365" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'parents, hxxe made'">
parents, have made</ins> in our kingdom, since we have abolished
all exercise of the said religion, is a sufficient proof that they
have embraced the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion,
<em>without which they would have been neither suffered nor tolerated</em>.”—Neither
suffered nor tolerated!—Had the law
commanded the killing of all the recusants to the very last?
No! Or had they been all banished from the kingdom? No!
on the contrary, they had been prohibited from quitting it,
and this interdiction had been renewed two years previously.
Thus, on one side, they were prevented from quitting France,
and on the other, it was concluded that they were (Roman)
Catholics because they remained in it!</p>

<p>The Parliament of Paris, so complaisant up to this time
where laws of intolerance were concerned, delayed the registration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
of the declaration of 1715 for a month. “The king,”
said the procurator-general, “has indeed abolished the exercise
of the pretended Reformed religion by his edicts, but
he has not precisely ordained that the religionists should
abjure, and embrace the Catholic religion. It is difficult to
understand how a man who does not appear to have been
ever converted, should nevertheless have fallen back into
heresy, and that he should be condemned as if the fact were
proved.”</p>

<p>Louis XIV. died five months afterwards, declaring to the
Cardinals de Rohan and de Bissy, and to Father Letellier,
that he was wholly ignorant of the affairs of the Church,
that he had acted according to their desire, and that he threw
upon them the responsibility before God. At this last hour,
when pride is silent, and all illusions fall away, did he not
find himself confronted face to face with grievous errors and
deep remorse?</p>

<p>Under the regency of Philippe d’Orléans, who hated the
Jesuits and drove Letellier from the court, the Reformed
again entertained some hope. This hope was increased, too,
when the regent allied himself with the Protestant powers
against Spain. Far from being blinded by bigotry, this
prince was even wanting in any religious conviction at all.
His indifference, in the absence of a superior and more praiseworthy
principle, would probably dispose him to lend a
favourable ear to the complaints of the Reformed.</p>

<p>He did, in fact, debate whether he should retrace the step
of the Edict of Revocation. But besides that his libertine
life hindered him from long engaging upon important affairs,
two things turned him from his project. One was the fear
of raising the great majority of the clergy against him, the
other was the recollection of the old wars of religion. The
Duke de Saint-Simon represented to him the renewal of
these wars as imminent, if he abolished the ordinances of
Louis XIV. This was at once a gross anachronism and contradiction;
for the Reformed would have been so much the more
peaceable, as they would have been better guaranteed in the
free exercise of their religion; however, the Duke d’Orléans,
who understood and cared nothing about these matters,
thought it expedient to leave the ecclesiastical laws as they
were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<p>The idea was also conceived of founding a colony of refugees,
who by obtaining freedom of worship, might enrich the
state by their industry. The council of the interior inclined
to this; but the council of conscience refused, and the regent
spoke no more about it. It would in reality have been too
evidently illogical to have permitted the exercise of the Protestant
religion in one part of the kingdom, while continuing
to exclude it in every other.</p>

<p>The Duke d’Orléans replied to the numerous petitions of
the religionists, that he hoped to find in their good conduct
the opportunity of showing them a treatment conformable
to his prudence. Several convicts, on account of religion, were
liberated; departure from the kingdom became unrestricted,
and the intendants of Dauphiny, Guienne, and Languedoc,
who would have continued the system of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>,
received commands to be more moderate. Although this
was not toleration, yet persecution began to flag.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_VI">VI.</h3>
</div>


<p>The misfortune of the times produced, as we have already
seen, great disorder in the bosom of the Reformed communion.
There were no pastors or regular instructions.
The preachers, who travelled about Vivarais and Cevennes,
had more fervour than enlightenment, and more zeal than
judgment. Supernatural inspiration or ecstasy, which had
begun before the war of the Camisards, was not extinguished
with it. Men and women rose in the assemblies, and uttered
burning words, which influenced the mind of the audience,
but did not enlighten them. It will be remarked that
at the same time, the Jansenists had their fanatics and
thaumaturgists. In the primitive ages of the Church, the
errors of the Montanists and the Donatists had alike sprung
from the source of persecution. Every oppressed communion
has been perplexed by those, who supposed themselves to be
inspired.</p>

<p>Intelligent Protestants, or those of timid character, did
not go to hear these preachers; they confined themselves to
domestic worship, and observed externally some of the
ceremonies of (Roman) Catholicism. There was therefore a
double cause of ruin at work against the French Reformation—the
excesses of the fervent, and the concessions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
weak. It was necessary to provide a remedy, or everything
would be lost; it was necessary to re-awaken in the souls of the
religionists a living, and, at the same time, a rational piety, to
renew the bonds of discipline, to increase and to multiply
the assemblies by remodelling them, and to re-establish order
in the churches. Such was the mission of Antoine Court.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>He was born at Villeneuve-de-Berg, in the province of
the Vivarais, in 1696, and had followed from the age of
seventeen the mission of lecturer and preacher in the meetings
of the wilderness. As he belonged to a poor family, he
had not received a classical education; but he supplied this
defect by his natural qualities, his reflections, and knowledge
of the Scriptures. Antoine Court had the capacity to learn
much and quickly. In his latter years he even acquired an
erudition very uncommon upon religious questions, and the
history of Protestantism, the proof of which may be seen
in his answer to the Bishop of Agen, published under the
name of a <cite>French and Impartial Patriot</cite>.</p>

<p>A man, who has distinguished himself by his constant
sympathies for the Reformed churches of France, M. de
Végobre, has drawn the following portrait of Antoine Court.
[He possessed] sound, straightforward sense, a wonderful
facility of expression, both in speaking and writing; an
intrepid courage, joined with consummate prudence in all his
conduct; an astonishing vigour to support, without wearying
or slackening, the greatest fatigues of body and mind; the
most agreeable amenity in his intimate friendships, if we may
judge by his familiar letters; a purity of views and an integrity
of manners, which have ever been above all suspicion;
and an unshaken devotion to the holy cause to which he had
consecrated himself: these are the qualities which, standing
in lieu of the resources of education, which he was without,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
enabled him to inspire the people with confidence, and to
merit the name of “<em>Restorer of the Protestantism of France</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Four conditions appeared to him to be necessary for the
re-organization of the churches—regular religious assemblies;
a direct and inflexible combat against the disorders of the
inspired; the restoration of discipline by means of the consistories,
conferences, and synods; finally, the formation of a
body of pastors. The plan was vast, though judicious, but
its execution involved great difficulties.</p>

<p>Antoine Court established in the first place prayer meetings
wherever he could shelter his head. They were but
scanty in the beginning. “It was a great thing,” he says in
an apologetic memoir, written forty years afterwards, “when,
by force of cares and solicitation, I could anywhere induce
six, ten, or a dozen persons to follow me to some mountain
cave, or deserted grange, or to the open country, to render
homage to God and to hear the discourse I wished to address
to them. What a consolation, however, it was to me to find
myself, in 1744, in assemblies of ten thousand souls in the
same spot where I had with difficulty gathered together,
during the first meetings of my ministry, fifteen, thirty,
sixty, or at most a hundred persons!”</p>

<p>He next, with the view of remedying the disorders caused
by the inspiration, convoked the preachers of Cevennes, to
whom he joined some enlightened laymen. The first of
these conferences or synods assembled on the 21st of August,
1715, eleven days before the death of the king, who thought
he had crushed the French Reformation. Other synods
succeeded from year to year. They were held in the depth
of a cavern, or in an isolated hut; for if they had been discovered,
all the members, or at least the preachers, would
have been capitally executed.</p>

<p>Antoine Court, notwithstanding his youth, was the guide
and soul of these meetings, and the adhesion of the preachers
proved that there was among them neither unbelief nor
pride, but simply involuntary error or want of sufficient
instruction. They only required to be better advised and
directed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span></p>

<p>We will recount some of the dispositions, which were
adopted in these new synods. Elders were intrusted with
the duty of watching over the flocks, of convoking assemblies
in suitable places, of providing for the safety of the
pastors, and of making collections for prisoners and the
poor. Women were prohibited from speaking in the meetings
of the faithful. The Bible was enjoined as the sole rule
of faith, and individual revelations were rejected as anti-Scriptural
and dangerous. (Synod of 1715.)</p>

<p>Fathers of families were exhorted to celebrate worship at
home three times a day, and to consecrate at least two hours
to devotions on Sunday. Those, who committed grave
offences, were to be censured in public, after three admonitions
in private. The pastors were recommended carefully
to explain all the articles of religion, to procure information
respecting vices most common in each district, with a view to
their correction, and to assemble every six months for the
purpose of intercommunication. If any pastor caused scandal
to his brethren, or endangered them by his hasty zeal, he
was to be immediately deprived of his appointment. An
engagement was entered into to succour those, who had
suffered in the cause of religion, but to give no assistance to
any, who exposed themselves to persecution by their rashness.
(Synods of 1716 and 1717.)</p>

<p>Of the six first subscribers to these regulations, four
perished on the scaffold; there is blood upon every succeeding
page of French Protestantism.</p>

<p>Antoine Court had not received pastoral ordination. He
induced one of his fellow-labourers, Pierre Corteis, to undertake
a journey to Switzerland in order to be consecrated.
On his return to Languedoc, Corteis laid hands on Antoine
Court in the presence of a synod. The chain of time was
thus continued, and the sacraments were no longer administered
by any but ministers ordained according to the rules
of discipline.</p>

<p>In 1718, a synod, consisting of forty-five members, ministers
and elders, decided that young men should be intrusted
with pastoral functions after a serious examination of their
doctrine and morals. Two years later, the remuneration of
the pastors was fixed at seventy livres, for their clothing and
entire provision. They were lodged and maintained, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
house to house, by the faithful. Their salary was afterwards
increased to six hundred livres, and towards the end of the
century to nine hundred livres. It was not more than the
pay of a workman; but it was not the appetite for money
that attracted men who, by accepting the pastoral charge,
devoted themselves to an almost certain martyrdom.</p>

<p>The churches were invited to establish consistories, in
default of which they were not to be visited by the ministers,
nor to receive notice of the convocation of the assemblies—a
spiritual punishment for a spiritual offence. This was a return
to true ecclesiastical order.</p>

<p>The assemblies of the wilderness, as they were called, were
held in open day, when the danger was not excessive, at
night when persecution was rigorous, in some wild retreat,
or in rocky nooks and quarries during adverse weather.
The summonses were issued only a few hours before the
meeting, and by emissaries of the most trustworthy character.
Sentinels were placed about the heights, but unarmed, so
that they might give the signal of the approach of soldiers.</p>

<p>The most intelligent and courageous acted as guides to
the pastors, and after the service, conducted them to a secure
shelter. Rarely did a pastor remain several days following
in the same asylum. Wandering from place to place, forced
to assume a thousand disguises, and bearing a borrowed name,
he was compelled to hide himself like a malefactor, in order
to proclaim the God of the Gospel. Such also was the life
of the (Roman) Catholic priest under the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of 1793;
the names of the persecutors change, but not the characters,
nor the excesses of the persecution.</p>

<p>The worship in the desert was the same as in the times
of liberty; liturgic prayers, singing of psalms, preaching,
administration of the holy supper on feast-days; a simple
worship, easily practicable everywhere, and which required
no more preparation than that of the “upper room furnished,”
in which the apostles and primitive Christians
assembled at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>This simplicity, however, possessed a charm of nobility
and grandeur, the calm of solitude suddenly broken by the
voice of prayer; the songs of the faithful mounting to the
invisible Being, in the presence of the magnificence of nature;
the minister of Jesus Christ invoking his God, like the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
of the primitive church, for the oppressors who raged
because they had not yet led Him to the scaffold; poor
peasants and humble artificers, who, laying aside their tools
of labour for a day, felt anxiety for naught but the sublime
interests of the faith of the life to come; the common sentiment
of danger which placed their souls continually in presence
of their sovereign Judge, endued all the assemblies of
the wilderness with that serious majesty, which allies itself
so well with the teaching of Christianity.</p>

<p>But whilst the French Reformation rose slowly from its
ruins, a fresh blow was silently preparing to strike it anew.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_VII">VII.</h3>
</div>


<p>This was the last great law against the Reformed, which
was published on the 14th of May, 1724, in the form of a
royal declaration. If it was never thoroughly executed to
the letter, [although] it was often applied; and as it remained
officially in force during sixty-three years, until the Edict of
Toleration of Louis XVI., it is important that its origin,
spirit, and principal articles should be made known.</p>

<p>The chief author of this law was Lavergne de Tressan,
bishop of Nantes, almoner to the duke of Orleans, and a
worthy acolyte of Cardinal Dubois, whom he had consecrated.
Irreligious and immoral, and so avaricious as to have accumulated
sixty-three benefices, he coveted the Roman purple,
and thought that he could not prove his title to it better
than by completing the extermination of the heretics.
Lavergne de Tressan presented his project to Dubois and
to the regent, each of whom refused to entertain it. He was
more successful with the Duke de Bourbon, who had been
appointed minister by Louis XV. This Duke de Bourbon
was a severe and haughty man, of ignoble aspect, deficient at
once both in convictions and intelligence, governed by shameless
female favourites, and innocent of having ever passed
any other than barbarous laws. He ordained, among other
things, that all beggars should be branded with a hot iron.</p>

<p>Some magistrates, it is said, also had a hand in the declaration
of 1724; they introduced certain modifications which
were unfavourable to the domination of the clergy, as afterwards
appeared.</p>

<p>The edict contained eighteen articles. It was a compilation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
of the most severe ordinances issued against the Reformed
under the reign of Louis XIV., with, in general,
aggravated penalties. The odious fiction was relied upon,
that there were no longer any Protestants in France; and
Louis XV., then fourteen years of age, was made to say in
the preamble, that he had nothing so much at heart as to
pursue the lofty designs of his right honoured lord and
great-grandfather, and that he was desirous of enunciating
his intentions explicitly.</p>

<p>For these reasons, he declared as follows—the punishment
of perpetual imprisonment at the galleys for men, and seclusion
during life for women, with confiscation of their property,
if they attended any other worship than that of the (Roman)
Catholic religion; punishment of death against all the
preachers; of the galleys or imprisonment against those who
sheltered or assisted them in any way whatever, and against
those who omitted to denounce them; an order to parents to
have their children baptized within twenty-four hours by the
curate of the parish, to send them to the (Roman) Catholic
schools and catechisms until the age of fourteen, and to the
Sunday and feast-day teachings until the age of twenty; an
order to midwives to report all births to the priests, and to
physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries to give notice of every
serious illness of the new converts, and authority for the
priests to have interviews with the sick by themselves. If
any one refused the sacraments or directed a member of his
family to refuse it, he incurred the penalty of having relapsed.
There was to be no legitimate marriage, except such as were
celebrated according to the canons of the Church. Parents
were not allowed to send their children out of the kingdom
to be educated, nor to marry them there; but on the other
hand, the minors of those parents who were abroad, might
marry without the consent of their relations. The certificates
of Catholicity were declared obligatory for all offices,
all academic degrees, all admissions to trading corporations.
Finally, the mulcts and confiscated property were to be
appropriated for the relief of the re-united subjects who
might be in want.</p>

<p>Never since the origin of human society, had the legislator
more insolently disregarded the law of nature, the civil law,
family, property, the liberty and sacredness of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
faith. This afforded another proof to what monstrous acts
one is driven when, by confounding spiritual and temporal
matters, the laws of the state are made subordinate to the
maxims of the (Roman) Catholic church.</p>

<p>Historians unite in a common expression of horror at the
Edict of 1724. Sismondi says, “It is with astonishment
that we behold, in this infidel age, when the reins of power
were held by a prince without belief or probity, and by a
female courtier without modesty, the renewal of a persecution
which the rigid faith of Louis XIV. could scarcely
explain.... The clergy, who had not dared to ask for
this inopportune law, accepted it with transport.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>M. Charles Lecretelle also observes, “The first act of the
government was as absurd as it was odious. It was even a
more cruel edict against the Protestants than the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. The most secret exercise of
the Reformed religion was prohibited. Children were torn
from their parents to be reared in the (Roman) Catholic
religion.... In short, every kind of oppression that had
been conceived by the ministers of Louis XIV., and that
public horror had begun to render obsolete, was renewed.
The Marchioness de Prie, whose impiety equalled that of
Cardinal Dubois, persuaded her lover (the Duke de Bourbon)
that he was acting upon the great principles of a statesman,
by recommencing a new persecution. Everybody was
disgusted by these efforts, which vice made to assume the
appearance of zeal, and in this barbarous folly, regretted the
regent’s toleration.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Rulhières and the Baron de Breteuil affirm that the council
were surprised into sanctioning this edict. They
prove that laws, inspired by two very opposite tendencies,
had been strangely confounded in its compilation. The
Molinist or Jesuitical spirit sought to employ universal outward
constraint, consenting at the same time to a relaxation
of all the interior conditions of Catholicity. The Jansenist
spirit had, on the contrary, exacted rigorous conditions of
Catholicity, but desired no constraint. Thus there was one
of two things—either the employment of physical force,
with a simple appearance of union with (Roman) Catholicism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
or real union, without the employment of material force.
But on the declaration of 1724, it was required, at one and
the same time, that all people should be (Roman) Catholics
under pain of the galleys and death, and that they should
perform acts of Catholicity, which only good (Roman)
Catholics could do. This was impracticable and absurdly
impossible.</p>

<p>We should here observe the great change, which had
begun to display itself in the conduct of the priests. On the
eve and on the day of the Revocation, they widely extended
their arms, as we have remarked before. They seemed to
say to the Protestants, “Come, all of you, just as you are.
We will be satisfied with the most vague and general abjuration.
We will not interfere with you at the domestic
hearth. It is enough if you only call yourselves Catholics
and observe the principal forms of the Church.”</p>

<p>But subsequently, their language and their conduct sensibly
changed, and their exactions increased from year to
year, particularly when the law had declared that there
were Protestants in the kingdom no longer. “Take heed,”
the priests said; “we cannot administer the sacraments to
false brethren; this would be an abominable profanation.
We must have long and severe proofs, instructions of six
months, a year’s, two years’ duration, solemn oaths; in short,
a complete certainty that you are true and faithful Catholics.
Otherwise, we will not celebrate your marriages, nor give
you certificates of Catholicity, and you may maintain your
civil rights as best you can.”</p>

<p>This alteration, continually more marked, is naturally
explained by the disastrous defeats the priests had suffered
since the Revocation. They imagined that the demolition of
the places of worship, the banishment of the pastors, the
deprivation of all regular instruction, the want of a religion,
the legal duty of performing acts of Catholicity, would restore
true believers to the Church, at least in the second generation.
But their expectation had been deceived, particularly
with regard to the country people and the industrial classes.
Children and grandchildren hated the (Roman) Catholic
church as much as their fathers; and they regarded the
curates with no less detestation and contempt.</p>

<p>Tired of acting so miserable a part, they resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
administer the sacraments to none but the most undoubted
(Roman) Catholics, and they were perfectly right; but
they should then have disavowed and rejected the intervention
of physical constraint, which they did not. They persisted
in calling for rigour, as if they were satisfied with
appearances, and to exact positive proofs of religion, as if
they employed rigour no longer! A more enormous and
detestable contradiction has never been witnessed!<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Then, having arrived at this degree of inconsequence, the
clergy came into collision with the magistracy, and this is a
new phase of the question, which it is important to understand;
for all the remainder of this history until 1787 is
involved in it.</p>

<p>If the councillors of the Parliaments, and the magistrates
generally, exhibited severity against the Reformed, they
always implied that the priests should administer the sacraments
without exacting excessive proofs. From the reign
of Louis XIV., their decrees might be interpreted in the following
manner:—“We are absolutely determined that your
marriages shall be blessed by a priest, and that your children
shall be presented for Catholic baptism; otherwise,
you shall have no civil status; your unions shall be illegal,
and your children shall be attainted with illegitimacy; in
certain cases, even, you shall forfeit your property and be
condemned to the galleys. But reassure yourselves, we will
require nothing but simple formalities. It is agreed that
the clergy shall impose nothing else, and we will abide by it.”</p>

<p>Relying upon these maxims, the Protestants conceived
that they were authorized in conceding to the priests as little
as possible; but the latter replied,—“The opinion of the
judges is nothing to us. The clergy alone have the light of
deciding in sacramental matters. No human power can
compel us to give them to those whom we think unworthy.
Attend the mass and our instructions for years; confess
yourselves regularly; show yourselves, in a word, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
faithful Catholics, and you shall participate in the favours of
the Church; otherwise you shall not.”</p>

<p>Strange spectacle! The judge insisted upon the execution
of the laws, because he interpreted them in one sense,
and the priest applied them in another. The first was only
solicitous for civil unity; the latter was anxious above all
things for spiritual unity. One only obliged the Protestants
to be (Roman) Catholics outwardly; the other used the sentence
to force them to be so internally. To such an anomalous
state of things had these edicts given birth, which had
ceased to correspond with the general conscience of the
epoch. Even the (Roman) Catholics themselves, it is well
known, had analogous conflicts in respect of the refusal of
the sacraments to the Jesuits, and the certificates of confession.
The only solution of the problem lay in the mutual
independence, that is now proclaimed in all the constitutions,
of the civil and the religious state.</p>

<p>The Baron de Breteuil shows, in a memorial addressed to
Louis XVI., the inextricable embarrassment that had arisen
with regard to the Protestants. He says: “On one side,
there is the absolute necessity of the certificate of Catholicity;
on the other, a scrupulous and arbitrary examination before
granting this certificate. What else than laws of impossible
execution could result from all these confused ideas, from all
these incoherent and contradictory dispositions?... These
unfortunate people, alike rejected by our tribunals under one
name, and repulsed by our churches under another name,
unrecognised at the same time as Calvinists, and unrecognised
as converts, wholly unable to obey laws which oppose each
other, and thereby destitute of every means of proving,
either before a priest or before a judge, the evidence of their
births, their marriages, and their burials, are cut off, as it
were, from the family of mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The illustrious Chancellor d’Aguesseau has stated the
dilemma in a very perfect manner. “Either the Church
must relax its rigour by some modification, or if the Church
does not think it ought to do so, it must cease to importune
the king to use his authority to reduce his subjects to an
impossibility, by commanding them to fulfil a religious duty,
which the Church will not permit them to discharge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<p>And, indeed, the declaration of 1724, while it repeatedly
engendered frightful consequences, was never fully executed.
It contained, moreover, dispositions revolting against the
most sacred feelings of human nature, justice, and society.
To punish with the galleys and confiscation of wealth a son,
or a daughter, who addressed pious exhortations to a dying
father; to inflict a similar punishment upon whoever should
fail to denounce his pastor, or should open to him the door
of his house; to load with a fine the physician who should
refuse to discharge the infamous office of informer—all this,
as M. de Sismondi remarks, bore the stamp of so barbarous
and savage a fanaticism, that it may be doubted if the code
of any other nation has approached it. Were it possible,
again, in the eighteenth century, to write similar atrocities
in the laws, it would be impossible to find judges and administrators
to carry them out.</p>

<p>As it always happens, atrocity engendered ridicule. Some
of the priests instituted a roll-call of children in the Church,
after the example of serjeants at a military review, and
noted those who were absent that their parents might be
fined. But the children frequently refused to answer, mocked
the curate, and disturbed his mass. What could be done?
Where were the means of punishment, when it might be
required to send a whole population, fathers, mothers, and
children, to the galleys?</p>

<p>Cardinal Fleury, who governed the kingdom after the
Duke de Bourbon, seems to have comprehended this difficulty.
Having been engaged in his youth on a mission with Fénélon
in Saintonge, and passed many years in Provence, he was
acquainted with the invincible firmness of the Protestants.
This, conjoined with the alliance of this priest with Great
Britain and Holland, the mildness of his character, and his
desire of sparing Louis XV. the anxieties of government,
will explain his conduct towards the Protestants. He did
not destroy the sword of intolerance, but he willingly let it
remain in the scabbard.</p>

<p>The curates of Cevennes addressed several urgent remonstrances
to him upon this subject. They bitterly complained
of the increasing desertion of the Huguenots. The aged
cardinal gave little heed to them; he was engrossed with
other affairs, and feared disturbance more than heresy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p>The persecution, therefore, was only local and momentary,
according to the humour of the intendants. Some meetings
were surprised and dispersed by the soldiery; some families
were ruined, and other unfortunates were condemned to the
galleys. The pastors, particularly, were tracked with implacable
cruelty, in the hope that the terror of death would
induce them to quit the kingdom.</p>

<p>Many of them were capitally executed. We will cite [the
case of] the minister Alexander Roussel, who was hanged at
Montpellier, on the 30th of November, 1728, respecting whose
martyrdom a popular complaint has come down to us. He
was sold for a bribe, and confessed without hesitation that he
had preached in Cevennes. When he was asked where he
lodged, he replied: “The heaven is my covering.” The
Jesuits vainly solicited him to change his religion; his answer
was: “I will ever keep the law of Jesus Christ: if
I die for His sake, I shall dwell with angels.” He was
dragged to the gallows with the rope about his neck,
bareheaded and barefoot, singing the 51st psalm, and
died uttering prayers to God for his judges and the executioner.</p>

<p>Another pastor, Pierre Durand, who, with Antoine Court,
had signed the first deliberations of the synods of the wilderness,
was also executed at Montpellier, on the 22nd of
April, 1782. He was a man full of years, and noted for his
faith and zeal. Five priests accompanied him to the scaffold,
and endeavoured to wrench from him an abjuration at any
price. Durand remained firm to the last.</p>

<p>These executions afflicted the Protestants of the wilderness,
but did not cast them down. The very exactions of the
clergy themselves conspired to drive them from the Church
of Rome; for seeing that they would not be satisfied with
simple forms of (Roman) Catholicism, they resolved upon
renouncing the Church in their turn, and that completely.
From this time the number of baptisms and marriages of the
wilderness multiplied, in spite of the civil disabilities which
attainted them.</p>

<p>Antoine Court strengthened and encouraged the faithful
by his exhortations and his example. In 1728 he undertook
a tour of nearly a hundred leagues, convoked thirty-two
religious meetings in two months, and counted as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
as three thousand hearers at the foot of his pulpit; even the
most timid began to be emboldened.</p>

<p>The synods rapidly increased, and became more rigid
against the parents, who allowed their children to be baptized
in the (Roman) Catholic church, or to be married there.
They also insisted upon the duty of taking part in the religious
services. The synod of 1730 says: “Write to the
Protestants under the Cross, that they may know the indispensable
obligation they are under to attend the meetings of
piety, whenever Providence shall furnish the opportunity. If
after being sufficiently instructed in this duty, they refuse
to fulfil it, it shall be declared that they are cut off from the
Church of the Lord, and are no longer His children.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that these men, who were
denied all the rights of citizens, were so bent upon discharging
all its duties, that they employed their authority in repressing
contraband trade. They thus decided in 1730:
“The members of our churches who, to escape paying the
king’s dues, shall carry on or countenance smuggling, shall be
first censured, and then, if they relapse, exposed to final excommunication.
The assembly does not in this article comprise
the contraband commerce in religious books, which do
not anywise prejudice the king or the state.”</p>

<p>The re-awakening of Languedoc and Dauphiny excited a
pious rivalry in other provinces. Rouergue, Guienne, Quercy,
Saintonge, Aunis, and Poitou, held meetings again and demanded
pastors. There were but few. Antoine Court
sought the young men who appeared fitted for this holy
vocation at the plough, in the trader’s warehouse, in the
workman’s shop; but the instruction they derived from a
wandering life was insufficient.</p>

<p>The restorer of French Protestantism began to reflect
upon the necessity of a theological school. To open it in
France was not to be dreamed of. The universities of England
and Germany were too distant from the southern provinces,
and did not speak their language. Geneva was too
near, and its academy too severely watched. Antoine Court
decided upon Lausanne. His long and urgent solicitations,
his indefatigable endeavours, the liberality of Switzerland,
England, and the other Protestant powers, contributed to
found there a French theological seminary. Court went to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
establish it himself, in 1730, with the title of deputy-general
of the churches, and directed this school during the thirty
concluding years of his life. It was this college that sent
forth all the Protestant pastors until the reign of Napoleon.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_VIII">VIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Before we proceed to relate the events, which will conduct
us beyond the year 1750, it is but a duty of justice which
we owe to the refugee pastors, to follow them in their exile;
they had all ceased to live in the former half of the eighteenth
century. Although they died upon a foreign soil, the French
Reformation has a right to claim them: they belong to it
by their birth, their education, the first years of their ministry,
by the language they used, and by the constancy of
their sympathy for their oppressed brethren.</p>

<p>We shall not speak of the lay refugees, whose names are
illustrious in literature, science, and industry, such as Rapin
Thoyras, the learned Bayle, Denis Papin, the constructor
of machines, the chemist Lémery, the traveller Chardin,
and many others. We must confine ourselves to those fugitives,
who exercised a direct influence upon the state of the
Reformed churches of France.</p>

<p>It is universally acknowledged, that the majority of the
fugitive pastors was composed of pious and intelligent men
of irreproachable character. No Protestant clergy in Europe
were superior to them. We will only mention the principal
among them, arranging them according to the date of their
death.</p>

<p>Pierre Jurieu (1637-1713) was a laborious and vehement
controversialist. He has had numerous opponents among
the (Roman) Catholics and the sceptics, and his memory has
suffered in consequence. It must be confessed that he gave
occasion to certain attacks by his venturous predictions, his
assertions concerning suspected miracles, and the sharpness
of his polemics. But these defects were redeemed by a host
of estimable qualities; a firm attachment to his religious
persuasions, an incomparable activity, a solid erudition in
every branch of theological science, and a clear and ready
wit. He never lacked penetration to discover error, or
courage to combat it.</p>

<p>He did not long exercise the functions of a pastor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
Nominated in 1674 professor of theology at Sédan, he made
his appearance with much <i lang="fr">éclat</i>. Bayle, who pursued him
at a later period with so many invectives, at that time
wrote: “He is one of the first men of his age, and if the
delicacy of his constitution does not offer resistance to his
ardour for study, and to his application to the functions of his
office, everything may be expected of him. I tell you, and
I repeat it, he is the first man of our communion, whether it
be for sound judgment or for the nicety of his wit.”</p>

<p>It is not sufficiently known, that during his retreat in
Holland, some years before the Revocation, he was almost
the <em>only opponent</em> (<i lang="fr">le seul tenant</i>, as they called it), of
Arnauld, Bossuet, Nicole, and Maimbourg. The others,
being still in France, dared not speak out. But in his pulpit
at Rotterdam, he recoiled before no truth, and his strong
and unfettered voice often inflicted the most severe and just
chastisements upon the persecutors.</p>

<p>Nor is it sufficiently known that he became, after the fatal
edict, the protector of a crowd of refugees, that he solicited
and procured for them the assistance of several sovereigns,
and that at the same time he gave them the shelter of hospitality,
he consoled and encouraged their brethren, who
languished at home, by his <cite>Pastoral Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>The list of Jurieu’s works is very extensive. While yet
with his flock at Vitry-le-Français, he composed a <cite>Treatise on
Devotion</cite>, which was reprinted seventeen times within a few
years, and twenty-six times in an English translation. This
work has induced the regret that the author, absorbed by
controversy, did not employ more of his time in writing
books of simple edification.</p>

<p>His reply to Father Maimbourg, <cite lang="fr">Le Calvinisme et le
Papisme mis en parallèle</cite> (“Calvinism and Popery Compared”),
less pointed than the answer of Bayle, and less
venomous, nevertheless obtained considerable applause, and
was greatly read. Claude wrote to him: “Your last work
against Maimbourg has at length reached me, and I have
not read, but devoured it, without the possibility of
quitting it. Everybody here (at Paris) of any note, with
any courage or zeal left, is charmed with the book.”</p>

<p>He answered the attacks of Nicole by the <cite lang="fr">Vrai Système de
l’Eglise</cite> (“The True System of the Church”), which competent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
judges declare to be his master-piece. In it Jurieu
develops the doctrine of the invisible church, in opposition to
the visible communion of Rome. He also produced <cite lang="fr">Histoire
Critique des Dogmes et des Cultes</cite> (“A Critical History of
Dogmas and Forms of Worship”), where humanity is considered
in its religious development. The illustrious defender
of the Reformed faith did not cease to wield his pen until
the eve of the day of his death.</p>

<p>Pierre Allix (1641-1717) withdrew to England after the
Revocation. He was only thirty years of age when he was
summoned to succeed to the Drelincourts and Daillés. His
discourses were full, solid, and distinguished for a sobriety
and a clearness of style that made them equally pleasing to
the educated and the ignorant. He had prepared his last
sermon upon the farewell of Saint Paul to the Ephesians, to
be preached at Charenton; but the place of worship was
closed by the kings order eight days sooner than was expected.</p>

<p>“Doctor Allix,” says one of his biographers, “was loved
and esteemed by all the learned men of his time. Extremely
zealous for the Protestant religion, he was always ready to
undertake its defence against the partisans of the Romish
church. He passionately desired to unite the Protestants,
particularly the Lutherans, with the Reformed, and he frequently
consulted the ministers of Geneva, Holland, and
Berlin, on this subject. He had a profound acquaintance
with all the sciences. He was well versed in the Hebrew,
Syriac, and Chaldean languages; and as his erudition was
vast, and his memory excellent, he was a kind of living
library.” Some writers of great weight have considered him
to be the most learned of the ministers of Charenton.</p>

<p>Pierre Allix received at London the title of Honorary
Doctor, from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The
Anglican clergy had so high an opinion of his ability that
they confided to him the task of writing <cite>The History of
the Councils</cite>, and even the Parliament bestowed upon him
particular marks of consideration.</p>

<p>Jean La Placette (1639-1718) was surnamed the Nicole of
the Reformed, on account of his numerous and judicious
moral writings. He equalled the Jansenist doctor in knowledge
of the human heart, and surpassed him in that of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
Scriptures. His style was simple and chaste, and he was,
above all, sincere in the highest sense of the word.</p>

<p>La Placette was a pastor of the French church at Copenhagen
for the space of twenty-six years (1685-1711). He
dedicated his <cite lang="fr">Nouveaux Essais de Morale</cite> (“New Moral
Essays”) to the queen of Denmark. “Our people,” he says
in the preface, “are far from comprehending the extent of
purity which the Gospel requires of us. They are even influenced
by a great number of false maxims, more pernicious
than errors of pure speculation. Besides, our writers—at
least those of our nation—have been forced by the importunity
of their adversaries, to give up all their leisure to the
defence of the truth, so that they have been able to compose
but a very few works of morality, and these only treat of
some particular matters. Thus, that part of religion, which
is, if I may venture to say so, the soul and essence of it, and
which it is so necessary should be well explained and understood,
has been in some sort neglected.”</p>

<p>David Martin (1639-1721) has acquired a popular name
in the Reformed communion of France by his corrections of
the old versions of the Bible. His translation, without
being free from defects, is nevertheless that which most
faithfully reproduces the simplicity and the vigour of the
original text. He was invited in 1694, by the synod of the
Walloon churches, to undertake this book and to accompany
it with critical reflections. Thirteen years after, he published
his new edition of the Bible, in two folio volumes.</p>

<p>This pastor had made the French language his particular
study. “So well had he mastered all the rules and niceties,”
says Nicéron, “that he was able to furnish remarks and
observations to the French Academy. He sent many to them
when the academy was about to print the second edition of
its dictionary; and the letter of thanks which he received in
return, shows the importance the Academy attached to his
criticisms.”</p>

<p>David Martin twice refused the professorial chair; but he
took pleasure in giving lectures at his house on theology,
to the young students of Utrecht. At the age of upwards
of eighty years he still preserved considerable mental vigour.
On the 7th of September, 1721, he preached upon Providence,
with a force which astonished all his auditory; at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
conclusion of the sermon he was unable to descend from the
pulpit but with the assistance of his friends, and two days
after drew his last breath. This pious divine had always
desired that he might die when leaving the house of God.</p>

<p>Jacques Basnage (1653-1723), grandson of Benjamin
Basnage, of whom we have already spoken, surpassed all the
members of his family in the variety of his acquirements,
the extent of his labours, and the grandeur of the part he
was summoned to play. “He was more fitted for a minister
of state than of a parish,” says Voltaire.</p>

<p>Basnage, in fact, participated in several important negotiations.
He took part in the conferences preceding the peace
of Utrecht, and demanded, but uselessly, the re-establishment
of religious freedom in France. Shortly afterwards, Cardinal
de Bouillon, who had retired to Holland, confided to him
the affairs he had to settle with the States-General. In 1716
the Abbé Dubois had recourse to the intermission of Basnage
to conclude a treaty with the United Provinces and England.
Singular spectacle! that of a poor exiled pastor influencing
the alliances of his native country!</p>

<p>The regent also addressed him to prevent the Spanish
Cardinal Alberoni from exciting insurrections among the
Protestants of the southern provinces. Basnage advised the
French government to put itself in communication with
Antoine Court, and this humble minister of the desert, condemned
to death by the laws [of his country], promised that
Languedoc should not be disturbed. On this occasion,
and at the express request of the Duke d’Orléans, Basnage
wrote a pastoral instruction for the Reformed of France,
which spread with rapidity. In it the author maintains the
principles of Christianity respecting the obedience due to
the sovereign; but, perhaps, after exhorting the oppressed
to submission, he might have said something more to the
oppressors.</p>

<p>Placed at the head of the French church of the Hague,
appointed historiographer to the States-General of Holland,
and surrounded by the esteem of the public, he was as happy
as an exile from his native land could be. “He was true,”
says a biographer, “even to the minutest things. The custom
of the highest society had imbued him with a politeness rarely
found in the learned. Affable and popular, his greatest pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
was to serve others, and to employ his credit in favour
of the unfortunate.”</p>

<p>It is surprising that he was able, in the midst of his political
occupations and the labours of his pastoral office, to
compose so many works on theology and ecclesiastical history.
Some of them are very voluminous, among others, <cite lang="fr">L’Histoire
de la religion des Eglises réformées</cite> (“The History of the Religion
of the Reformed Churches”); <cite lang="fr">L’Histoire des Juifs</cite>
(“The History of the Jews”); and that of the Church from
the time of the Christian era to the eighteenth century.
The erudition of Basnage is vast, his thought penetrating,
and his style firm; he raised controversy to a height that
has only been attained by Bossuet.</p>

<p>Jacques Abbadie (1654-1724) was the best apologist of
Christianity, and one of the most able writers of the Reformed
communion. After completing his studies at the
<ins class="corr" id="tn-386" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'acadamies of Sédan'">
academies of Sédan</ins> and Saumur, he entered into the service
of the French church of Berlin. “The only thing that
vexes me,” the Duke de Montausier said one day to the ambassador
of the elector of Brandenburg, when speaking of a
work of Abbadie, “is, that the author of this book should
be at liberty.” If France had lost one of her glories, who
was chargeable with the fault?</p>

<p>Abbadie afterwards withdrew to England, and died dean
of the parish of Killaloe in Ireland. We read in a notice
of his life: “His manners, polished by intercourse with good
society, were mild and easy, and a more even and obliging
temper never existed. As his mind was full of gaiety, and
he expressed himself upon all kinds of subjects with as
much elegance, correctness, and fire as in his meditated
works, his conversation was as agreeable as useful, and one
never quitted his company without regret.”</p>

<p>His treatise on <cite lang="fr">L’Art de se connaître soi-même</cite> (“The Art
of Knowing Oneself”) is full of judicious observations, and
shows that the author had profoundly meditated upon the
relations of the human conscience to the duties of the Gospel.
But the most celebrated of his works is the treatise on <cite lang="fr">La
Verité de la religion Chrétienne</cite> (“The Truth of the Christian
Religion”). It obtained the suffrage of (Roman) Catholics
as well as Protestants. “This admirable work,” said
the Abbé Desfontaines, forty years afterwards, “eclipses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
everything that has ever been published before it for the
defence of Christianity. How many conversions has it not
effected! How many strong minds has it not subjected!”</p>

<p>Madame de Sévigné wrote to the Comte de Bussi-Rabutin,
“It is the most divine of books; this esteem is general. I
do not believe any one has spoken of religion like this man.
I shall re-peruse it every three months for the remainder of
my life.” And the count answered with the same enthusiasm:
“Until now I have never been touched by other books,
which tell me of God, and now I see well the reason; it is
that the source appeared doubtful; but seeing it clear and
transparent in Abbadie, I value what I did not before esteem.
I repeat it, this is an admirable book. He pourtrays to me
everything he says, and compels my reason not to doubt that
which once appeared to it incredible.”</p>

<p>The author combats the Atheists in the first part of his
work, the Deists in the second, and the Socinians in the
third. He starts with this proposition, “There is a God,”
to arrive at this: “Jesus is the promised Messiah.” Then
he ascends from this last proposition to the first. The book
has been translated into several languages, and it has appeared
in a great variety of editions.</p>

<p>Elie Bénoît (1640-1728) was a learned and industrious
theologian. We discharge a debt of gratitude in consecrating
a few lines to the author of <cite lang="fr">L’Histoire de l’Edit de Nantes</cite>
(“The History of the Edict of Nantes”), of which we have
made great use in our own.</p>

<p>He was pastor of the church of Alençon, and had the
pain of seeing his place of worship closed, under the futile
pretext that the faithful had assumed a defensive attitude
on some occasion of their worship being interrupted by the
populace. He went to Paris in support of their cause; but
instead of obtaining the redress of his complaints, he was
answered by threats.</p>

<p>Bénoît took refuge in Holland, and published there a
letter addressed to his former parishioners. As we read in
his memoirs, they emigrated <i lang="fr">en masse</i>; for there remained in
France scarcely an eighth, which will serve to explain why
the town of Alençon ceases to figure in the catalogue of
the Reformed churches.</p>

<p>The chief work of Bénoît is the history we have so often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
quoted. It should be read by all who are desirous of studying
one of the most important periods of the French Reformation.
More brevity and precision might perhaps be
desired in this book, but assuredly not greater exactness. The
author displays a correct judgment, and a moderation which
proves him to have been swayed by no other passion than
that of truth.</p>

<p>Jacques Saurin (1677-1730) was the greatest preacher of
the French Protestants. He was born at Nismes, where his
father practised as an advocate, and received his early education
at Geneva. He was tempted, at the age of seventeen,
by the profession of arms, and became an ensign in the Savoyard
service. On the re-establishment of peace, he resumed
his academical studies under the learned teachers Tronchin,
Turretin, and Pictet.</p>

<p>In 1701 he was appointed pastor of a French church in
London; and some years subsequently, having visited
Holland and preached at the Hague, he received so much
applause that a new place was created for him, under the
title of “<em>minister of the nobles</em>:” he held it until his death.</p>

<p>From 1708 to 1725 he published five volumes of sermons;
seven others, inferior to the first, appeared posthumously.
He possessed all the great qualities of a Christian orator:
a profound knowledge of the Bible, a healthy and vigorous
theology, the art of devising learned and original plans, a
masculine logic, judicious and always serious ornaments, and
a style which was eminently subservient to thought; though
sometimes it might be desired that there had been more
unction in his speech and more correctness in his language.
The misfortunes of the faithful, to whom Saurin preached
the Gospel, enhanced his oratorical powers, by surrounding
it with a tragic poignancy. Some of his sermons have
thrown weight into the scales of the destinies of Europe.</p>

<p>The action, with which Saurin delivered his discourses, is
not so well known as their substance. The journalists of his
time speak of him in the following manner: “He has a
natural exterior which prepossesses the congregation in his
favour, whilst his voice is powerful and sonorous. Those, who
remember the magnificent prayer which he pronounced before
the sermon, will not have forgotten how the ear was filled
with the most harmonious sounds. It could have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
wished that his voice preserved the same <i lang="fr">éclat</i> until the end
of the action; but as we are not drawing a panegyric, we
may confess that he did not so well manage it. A little
less impetuosity would have freed him from this defect. The
expectation raised by the prayer was not disappointed by
the sermon; [that it was not so] we [may] confidently
appeal to his auditors. All, without any exception, were
charmed; and he who came with the intention to criticise,
gradually forgot his purpose, as he attentively sought to discover
something susceptible of criticism.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Saurin published letters upon the state of Christianity in
France. He reproached the Reformed with not having
quitted a country where they could not freely celebrate their
worship, and applied to them the name of temporisers. The
reproach was too severe, and it is not to be regretted that
his advice to emigrate <i lang="fr">en masse</i> was not followed.</p>

<p>He was accused before the Walloon synods of having
justified officious lying in his discourses upon the Bible.
This became the subject of a long and laborious polemical
contest. Saurin addressed this declaration to the synods:
“I have not pretended in my dissertation upon lying to do
anything else than to report <em>historically</em> the sentiments of
those who believe that lying is always criminal, and of those
who believe it to be innocent in certain cases. As for the
holiness and veracity of God, as well as the obligation which
binds men to speak the truth, I hold by the doctrine contained
in my catechism, which I will ever teach.”</p>

<p>It is related that Saurin, who in the pulpit was so skilful
in unravelling the passions of men and their secret motives
of action, was unable to discover them in society. He was
altogether wanting in experience of the world; and was
so full of confidence and candour, that it was as easy to deceive
him as a child. His life was frequently troubled in
consequence.</p>

<p>Jaques Lenfant (1661-1728) and Isaac de Beausobre (1659-1738),
are two names which ought to remain united in the
pages of history, since they have figured in joint works.
They were both pastors at Berlin, and had the same turn
of mind, the same taste for historical and critical studies, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
same belief, [and lived] the same religious life; whilst contemporary
memoirs attribute to both the same amiable
character.</p>

<p>Lenfant has written the history of the councils of Constance,
Pisa, and Basle—books dictated by science and conscience.
Voltaire says of him, that he contributed more
than any one to spread the grace and strength of the French
language to the furthermost parts of Germany. Beausobre,
for his part, has made for himself a name justly celebrated
by his history of Manichæism.</p>

<p>The two authors were associated in the publication of a
new edition of the New Testament, with critical notes. To
Beausobre were allotted the Epistles of Saint Paul, and to
Lenfant all the other books of the New Testament. The
task of the former was more difficult, that of the other of
greater extent. The biographer of Beausobre says: “This
distribution of the work did not prevent their working in
concert. When one was of a different opinion to the other,
they discussed and criticised, but each cheerfully submitted
to the strongest evidence.”</p>

<p>The successors of this illustrious generation of refugee
pastors and theologians belong to us no more. Born and
educated out of France, their glory is the property of the
countries that sustained them on their hospitable soil.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_IX">IX.</h3>

<p>We left the Reformed zealously labouring for the re-organization
of their churches. They restored vigorous action
to many of the articles of ancient discipline. The newly-established
consistories watched over the maintenance of
good order among the flocks. The meetings approached the
great centres of the Protestant population, and were held
more frequently by day. In a word, the period from 1730 to
1744 was a time of calm when compared with the horrible
tempest, which had dispersed and scattered everything but a
few years before.</p>

<p>The religious movement extended. A young pastor, who
joined great prudence to ardent faith, Michel Viala, traversed
Upper Languedoc, and held assemblies in the neighbourhoods
of Castres and Montauban. The county of Foix received
Pierre Corteis; Béarn, Etienne Deffère; and Poitou and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
Normandy, Jean Loire and André Migault. We see that
the pastors, whose number was always limited, were compelled
to discharge the duties of missionaries; their fields of
labour were far more extensive than dioceses.</p>

<p>With a view to the introduction of greater regularity into
their teaching and their maxims of conduct, they resolved
to convoke a general or national synod, and this assembly
was opened, on the 18th of August, 1744, in a secluded spot
in Lower Languedoc, under the presidency of Michel Viala.
The majority of the old Protestant provinces, from Cevennes
to Normandy, were represented at this meeting; but there
was no delegate from the Isle of France or Paris.</p>

<p>The moment was well chosen in one respect, and badly
in another. The Protestants could collect with greater
facility, because the war engaged all the attention of the
government and all the forces of the country abroad. But
this very war was certain to inspire the council with greater
displeasure at such an assembly.</p>

<p>The first step of the synod was to declare its inviolable
fidelity to the king. It ordered the celebration, before the
end of the year, of a solemn fast in all the Reformed flocks
of the kingdom, “for the preservation of the sacred person
of his majesty, for the success of his arms, for the cessation
of war, and for the deliverance of the Church.” The pastors
were exhorted to preach at least once a year upon the submission
due to “the powers that be.”</p>

<p>This meeting took wise measures for the observation of
discipline and the correction of manners. It invited the
pastors to abstain from treating of points of controversy in
the pulpit, and not to speak without circumspection of the
sufferings of the Reformed people. It recommended to the
flocks to celebrate their worship as much as possible in open
day. The tenth article of the resolutions stated, “As there
are many provinces, where the religious services are still
performed during the night, the synod, in order to manifest
still more the purity of our intentions as well as to preserve
uniformity, has directed the pastors and elders of the different
provinces to conform, as far as prudence will permit, to
the churches, which perform their service in daylight.”</p>

<p>Antoine Court came from Lausanne to be present at this
great meeting, and after appeasing a difference which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
arisen with regard to a pastor who had been falsely accused,
he had the joy of preaching to an audience of ten thousand
persons.</p>

<p>This assembly of so many of the faithful, this general
synod, of which the members came from the extremities of
the realm, this semi-publicity given to acts that the law
considered as criminal and rebellious, disturbed and irritated
the council, who began to fear that the Protestants maintained
a secret intelligence with foreigners.</p>

<p>Nothing was more false. From the sixteenth century, in
the very times of the most bloody persecutions, the mass of
the Reformed had never once forgotten their duty to their
sovereign and their country. If in the wars of the Camisards,
some of the <ins class="corr" id="tn-392" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Cévenols had looked'">
Cévenoles had looked</ins> to England or Holland
for assistance, it was only a local and partial affair.
But the apprehensions of the court, which continually broke
out afresh after the Edict of Revocation, prove the great
truth, that it is not possible to persecute with impunity.
When public authority ignores every condition of justice,
morality, and order, it is the first victim of its attempt; and
in default of the remorse, from which fanaticism or corruption
may relieve it, it expiates its crime by unceasing and
invincible terrors.</p>

<p>Calumny played its part in these deplorable circumstances;
and opinion, ignorant of the true sentiments of a proscribed
population, easily adopted the grossest falsehoods. It was pretended
that the pastor Jacques Roger had read a false Edict
of Toleration at the religious meetings, in order to drive the
Protestants to rebellion; that those who were present were
armed; that they had sung a hymn imploring God to bless
the English with victory; that their collections for the poor
were military taxes; that twenty-five thousand Camisards
held themselves in readiness to join the enemy, who blockaded
the ports of Provence; that the convents were to be pillaged,
the priests and the monks massacred, and the whole south
of France put to fire and sword.</p>

<p>These popular rumours were still more extravagant than
odious, and had not even a shadow of truth. Yet they
were believed at court, and the Baron Lenain d’Asfeld,
intendant of Languedoc, was directed to ascertain indirectly
from the consistories and pastors of the desert, if it were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
true that the religionists had understandings with the enemy.
He wished, moreover, to know if, in case of an invasion, the
government might count upon a rising of Protestant volunteers.
This was a new example of the effects of intolerance;
they thought themselves obliged to treat with Frenchmen
as if they were foreigners; and because they would not consider
them citizens, they were no longer trusted in their
country’s day of misfortune.</p>

<p>The Protestants answered, that not one of their co-religionists
would join the English armies, that they were all
ready to perform their duty for the service of the king; that
the pastors never ceased to recommend obedience, and that
if they contravened the laws in matters of religion, it was
under an obligation superior to all human authority.</p>

<p>The intendant Lenain, who had had many occasions of
studying the [character of the] Protestants, did not distrust
their assurances of fidelity. But it was not so at Versailles,
where objects were distorted by fear and distance. The
news of the national synod of 1744 produced those acts,
which seemed allied to madness.</p>

<p>Louis XV. was made to sign, in February, 1745, two
ordinances still more cruel, if that were possible, than any
that had preceded them. In addition to the penalty of
death against the pastors, and of perpetual imprisonment at
the galleys against those who harboured them, a fine of
three thousand livres was pronounced against all the Protestants
of the place where a pastor should be arrested. As
for the meetings, it was no longer necessary to have been
present at them in order to be doomed to the galleys and [to
suffer] forfeiture of property; it was sufficient not to have denounced
them. Everything was a crime according to these
laws; and out of fifteen hundred thousand Reformed, one-half
might have been condemned, at the end of six months, to
row in convict vessels, and the other half to beg their bread.</p>

<p>Although it was impossible to execute these ordinances
literally, and although the very men, who had drawn them
up, would not have suffered it, they were followed by cruel
disasters. The Protestants might send petitions upon petitions
to the king, to the ministers, to the intendants, to every
one who had power to help them; these requests, wherein
they stated in the humblest language their sufferings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
their unalterable sentiments of fidelity, did not reach their
address, and if they did arrive there, were never read. Some
were burned or fixed to the pillory by the hand of the
executioner, as if their complaints were less just because
they were stamped with ignominy.</p>

<p>Antoine Court has written an historical memoir upon the
persecutions that recommenced after the synod of 1744.
His integrity is as free from suspicion as his perfect acquaintance
with the events, and we therefore borrow from him the
facts we are about to relate.</p>

<p>The abduction of children multiplied in the provinces,
and particularly in Normandy. Court gives a list, and it is
very lengthy, name by name. This kidnapping was usually
carried on at night, like a brigand’s descent, by companies
of archers headed by the parish curates. When there was
a delay in opening the doors of the houses, they were burst
in, and then the soldiers, sabre in hand, with oaths upon
their lips, overthrowing everything in the search after their
prey, insulting the despair no less than the shrieks of the
mothers, and beating the fathers who dared to complain,
carried off the children, the young girls in preference, and
dragged them away to the convents. The parents were
obliged to furnish a pension for their maintenance, and if
one of the victims escaped, they were made responsible
for it. These horrors provoked a fresh emigration. Six
hundred families of Normandy profited by their proximity
to the sea to fly from the kingdom with everything they
could take with them.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Lettres de cachet</i> were again used against the people of
importance. The religionists of less consideration underwent
the sentences of the judiciary or administrative sentences.
The Parliaments of Grenoble, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and the
intendants of Saintonge, Guienne, Dauphiny, Quercy, and
Languedoc, relentlessly pursued the Reformed, who had
had their children baptized, or their marriages blessed in the
desert.</p>

<p>The religious meetings were spied, and attacked most
unmercilessly. On the 17th of March, 1745, two troops of
dragoons fell upon an assembly in the neighbourhood of
Mazamet, killed several persons, wounded a greater number,
and carried off many prisoners. Scenes of the same kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
were enacted near Montauban, Uzès, Saint Hippolyte, Saint
Ambroix, and in other places. It was again necessary to
have recourse to night meetings.</p>

<p>From 1744 to 1746 we count three hundred persons who
were condemned to be flogged, to be degraded from the
nobility, to be imprisoned for life, to the galleys, or to death,
by the single Parliament of Grenoble, which showed a most
pitiless spirit, because it administered justice in a border
province, and at only a few steps from the enemy’s camp
upon the Alps. The fines were enormous. In a petition
addressed to the king in 1750, the Protestants of Dauphiny
stated that they had been obliged to pay more than two
hundred thousand livres, and that from the depth of their
prisons, they heard their goods and their inheritances sold
by auction.</p>

<p>The same things happened in the provinces of the south,
though to a less extent. Nismes paid upwards of sixty thousand
livres. The intendants coined money out of heresy, as
was afterwards done in 1793 out of the aristocracy.</p>

<p>“I could produce here,” says Antoine Court, “first a list
of more than six hundred prisoners arrested since 1744 (he
wrote in 1753), in the provinces of Languedoc, the Upper
and Lower Alps, Vivarais, Dauphiny, Provence, the county
of Foix, Saintonge, and Poitou; among whom were many
gentlemen, advocates, physicians, substantial burghers, and
rich tradesmen, who have suffered long and cruel imprisonment,
out of which they have escaped by arbitrary and ruinous
fines alone. I could produce another catalogue of more
than eight hundred prisoners who have been condemned to
divers punishments, among whom more than eighty were
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Some of the condemned obtained their pardon through
the intervention of powerful protectors, or by means of
pecuniary sacrifices, after having passed a certain time in
confinement; and this explains how it was that, in 1753,
there remained at Toulouse more than forty-eight convicts
on account of religion. Allowances must also be made for
the mortality which struck a great number of these unfortunate
persons, [who had been] suddenly degraded from a
position of competency to a condition so abject.</p>

<p>The glass-makers of the county of Foix were condemned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
by the intendant of Auch, to perpetual imprisonment at the
galleys, and forfeiture of all their property. One of them,
Grenier de Lastermes, was a venerable old man of seventy-six
years. He underwent his sentence at the hulks of
Toulon: his two sons died, one near him, the other upon
the galleys of Marseilles. We have read a letter of this once
opulent old man, in which he thanks the consistory of Marseilles
for having allowed him two sous a day to alleviate his
misery! He wrote: “We are engaged upon the labours
marked out for us, having only bread and water for our
nourishment, without the opportunity of exemption, but by
payment of a <em>sol</em> every morning to the under-gaolers; otherwise
we are exposed to remain fastened to a beam with a
great chain, night and day.”</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i> were renewed at Milhau, Saint Affrique,
and at other places in Rouergue, Languedoc, and Dauphiny.
This was the punishment of the lower ranks of the people
for being present at the assemblies.</p>

<p>These sentences, if they had been less barbarous, would
have been laughable. Not only were the religionists persecuted
for having introduced Bibles and pious books into the
realm, but a poor man, named Etienne Arnaud, of Dieu-le-Fit,
was sentenced, in 1744, to imprisonment for life and the
pillory. For what? Because he had taught some young
folks to sing psalms. His psalter and a copy of the New
Testament were nailed to the pillory beside him.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_X">X.</h3>
</div>


<p>The pastors, however, continued to be the object of the
most implacable persecutions. If the government had reflected,
it would have seen, on one side, that the Reformed
were invincibly attached to their creeds, whether with their
pastors or without them; on the other, that their ministers
of religion did more good than harm, even in a political point
of view, since they restrained the explosion of the popular
resentment, and always recommended order, patience, and
respect for the law. But neither the intendants nor the
Parliaments were able to comprehend that these men were
among the number of the most useful citizens, and three
pastors were put to death in 1745 and 1746.</p>

<p>The first, Louis Rang, or Ranc, was twenty-six years of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
age. He was arrested at an inn of Levron, condemned to
capital punishment by the Parliament of Grenoble, and
executed at Die, in March, 1745.</p>

<p>A contemporary historian says: “At Crest, the minister
asked permission to be shaved, and to have his hair arranged.
This neatness appeared to him requisite the better to show
the serenity which reigned in his soul, and the contempt with
which he treated the unjust death he was about to suffer.
He met his end like a hero, and never did Christian exhibit
a more elevated calmness at such a moment. On his way to
execution, he chanted the verse of the 118th psalm: ‘<em>This
is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be
glad in it</em>,’ which he repeated several times. The speech he
attempted to make could not be heard, on account of the
noise of the drums, which were beaten purposely to smother
his voice. He would not hearken to the Jesuits who accompanied
him, but kept his eyes continually raised to heaven,
and gave signs of feelings of the most lively and earnest
piety. When he arrived at the foot of the ladder, he knelt,
prayed, and then mounted the scaffold courageously.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>His corpse was insulted by the populace; but a (Roman)
Catholic lady, who must have blushed for her faith, provided
a sepulchre for his wretched remains.</p>

<p>After this youthful servant of the Gospel, died the veteran
of the assemblies of the wilderness, Jacques Roger—who had
restored the churches with Antoine Court—an aged minister,
seventy years old. He was taken in the neighbourhood of
Crest. “Who are you?” demanded the officer of the patrol.
“I am,” he answered, “he whom you have long sought for,
and it is time that you should find me.” Like Ignatius of
Antioch, Jacques Roger sighed for the crown of martyrdom.</p>

<p>Confined with other Protestant prisoners, he exhorted
them to remain firm in the faith. When the executioner
came to summon him, he exclaimed: “This is the blessed
day, this is the glad moment I have so long yearned for.
Let us rejoice, my soul, for this is the happy day when thou
shalt enter into the joy of thy Lord.”</p>

<p>He beseeched the Jesuits, who importuned him, to cease
from troubling his mind in its repose, and walked to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
scaffold in the midst of the crash of the drums that were
continually beaten. “There was no one,” says Armand de
la Chapelle, “who did not read upon the countenance of this
holy confessor, the profound calmness, the sincere piety, and
the ardent zeal of his soul. Even the Jesuits spoke of him
with praise, and many persons of the Romish communion
could not refrain from showing how much they were touched.
When he had prayed on his knees at the foot of the ladder,
he mounted the steps with the same air of modest confidence,
which he had all along displayed.” His body was thrown
into the Isère, after it had been suspended twenty-four hours
on the gibbet.</p>

<p>The third victim, who excited the warmest sympathy, was
executed on the 2nd of February, 1746. His name was
Matthieu Majal, and he bore, according to the custom of the
desert pastors, the surname of Désubas. His age also was
twenty-six.</p>

<p>Having been surprised at Saint Agrève, in Vivarais, he
was taken to Vernoux. The news of his arrest spread universal
grief. When he passed through a village on the way,
some unarmed peasants supplicated the commanding officer
to release their pastor; and one of them, throwing himself
upon Désubas, closely embraced him, imploring his liberty.
The only reply was an order to fire upon the peasants, and
six were slain.</p>

<p>The next day—one of religious service—a more numerous
gathering, but similarly unarmed, penetrated into the town
of Vernoux. The officer, who dreaded a rising, ordered his
soldiers to fire from the houses against this crowd, whose
wailings and prayers were their only weapons. Thirty of
these unfortunates fell dead, and two or three hundred were
wounded.</p>

<p>Then the mountaineers of Vivarais flew to arms, and prepared
to avenge the murder of their brethren. Fortunately
the pastors hastened to intercede, and to beseech them, in the
name of their faith, their families, their country, in the name
of their common salvation, to refrain. “It is only on this
condition,” said the most revered of these pastors to them,
“that I will continue my ministry among you.”</p>

<p>Désubas himself wrote this note from his prison. “I implore
you, gentlemen, to retire. The king’s people are here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
in strong numbers; and too much blood has been spilled
already. I am calm, and entirely resigned to the Divine
will.”</p>

<p>The peasants yielded, and threw their arms away. But
along the road by which the pastor passed, from Vernoux to
Montpellier, they stood grief-stricken and indignant, with
difficulty repressing the promptings of their desire to rescue
him. All their ministers were there, hidden in the multitude,
and striving to appease it with the sacred words of the
Evangelist.</p>

<p>Désubas reached Montpellier at the time of holding the
States. The whole body of the clergy hastened around him,
soliciting but one word, one single word of abjuration. Vain
efforts! The pastor of the desert was more firm before the
seductions of his persecutors than before the tears of his
people: he had long devoted himself to death.</p>

<p>The intendant Lenain asked him, not for his own information,
but to acquit himself of the forms of his duty, if the
Protestants had not a common treasury, if they were not
collecting arms, and if they were not in correspondence with
England. “There is not a word of truth in it,” answered
the prisoner, “the ministers preach nothing but patience
and fidelity to the king.” “I know it, sir,” said the intendant,
deeply moved.</p>

<p>When sentence of death was pronounced against Désubas,
both the judges and the intendant wept. “It is,” he said,
“with sorrow that we condemn you, but such are the orders
of the king.” “I know it, sir,” replied the pastor of the
desert, in his turn.</p>

<p>The scaffold was erected upon the esplanade of Montpellier,
whither Désubas was conducted, bareheaded and barefoot,
in the midst of an innumerable concourse of spectators. The
papers and books which had been found upon him, were burnt
before his face; and when he sought to address the multitude,
the din of fourteen drums drowned his words. He
preserved a placid countenance, repulsed the Jesuits, who
held a crucifix to him, pronounced a short prayer, and
ascending the fatal ladder, gave up his soul to God.</p>

<p>We may here recognise the profound opposition that existed
between the laws and the manners of the period. The
magistrates, while they sentenced [Désubas], revolted against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
the legal text, whilst their hearts acknowledged him to be
innocent whom they were compelled to condemn as guilty.
All the (Roman) Catholics of any moral or intellectual education,
were thunderstruck at the execution of Désubas.
The Protestants, on the contrary, thanked God for having
given them so heroic a martyr, and his name is still heard in
the popular legends, beneath the cottage roof of the peasantry
of Vivarais and Languedoc.</p>

<p>Yet this renewal of the persecutions had exhausted the
patience of many of the Reformed. Seeing that they were
absolutely denied any approximation to religious liberty,
they demanded permission to sell their property and quit the
kingdom. They wrote to Louis XV.: “We cannot live
without following our religion, and we are compelled, however
unwillingly, to supplicate your majesty, with the most
profound humility and respect, that you may please to allow
us to leave the realm with our wives, our children, and our
effects, to retire into foreign countries, where we may freely
worship God in the form we believe to be indispensable, and
on which depends our eternal happiness or misery.”</p>

<p>Instead of granting this authority, the council replied by
an aggravation of severity, particularly after the peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748. The troops required employment;
the court had leisure; it remembered the uneasiness which
the heretics had caused it during the war, and it resolved to
attempt a decisive blow that should, if possible, put an end
once for all to this proscribed people.</p>

<p>It is painful continually to discover the hand of the (Roman)
Catholic clergy in these scenes of violence, spoliation,
and death. The venerable Malesherbes, the Baron de
Breteuil, Rulhières, Joly de Fleury, Gilbert de Voisins,
Rippert de Monclar, the gravest statesmen, the most eminent
magistrates, who have written upon the religious affairs
of this epoch, all proclaim this with unanimous voice. They
agree in characterizing the conduct of the priests as obstinate,
unrelenting, sometimes haughty, sometimes supple
and humble, but ever exacting the use of extreme measures
of compulsion and severity for the re-establishment of religious
unity.</p>

<p>What is still more intolerable is, that at the very time
when the clergy demanded the strict execution of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
horrible ordinances of 1724 and 1745, they never ceased to
declare that the Church was always adverse to all means that
were not charitable and paternal. Is it possible to conceive,
imagine, or dream of the possibility of so flagrant a contradiction?</p>

<p>What! knock at every door, besiege the offices of all the
ministers, address the sovereign, threaten, solicit, pray, even
offer money; and for what purpose? To oppress the conscience
of more than a million of Protestants; to persecute
them even in the sanctuary of domestic worship; to constrain
them to have their children baptized by a priest
under pain of bastardy; to compel married people to ask for
the (Roman) Catholic benediction under pain of being denied
any civil condition; to send soldiers, in a word, against the
meetings, gaolers and hangmen against the pastors; and all
this as only a labour of charity, goodness, and fraternal
love!</p>

<p>There was a bishop of Castres, who applied for a regiment
of dragoons in order to dissolve the meetings, taking care at
the same time to add that the soldiers should not injure his
flock, among whom he counted the re-united brethren. The
bishop of Aire forwarded complaints that the custom of
establishing the refusal of the sacraments at the death-bed of
heretics had fallen into desuetude, and he wanted to renew
the suits for the ignominious treatment of their corpses.
The Count de Saint Florentin, secretary of state for religious
affairs, who was not without complaisance for the clergy, was
obliged to address a very severe admonition to this prelate.</p>

<p>The notion of religious freedom, or even of simple toleration,
seems to have been absolutely unknown to the Romish
ecclesiastics of the time: they did not understand it; and if
they beheld an inkling of it in others, <ins class="corr" id="tn-401" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'they combated it'">
they combatted it</ins> as an act of impiety. We have a proof of this in a letter which
made considerable noise in 1751. It bore the signature of
Chabannes, bishop of Agen.</p>

<p>There had fallen into his possession a paper containing the
following matter: “It is the intention of the comptroller-general
to grant every kind of protection to the Sieur Frontin,
a Huguenot trader, and that he should be treated with
such consideration as may induce the merchants of his sect
to return to the kingdom.” In fact, the object was to afford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
the opportunity to some of the industrious refugees of again
peacefully residing in France.</p>

<p>The bishop immediately took pen in hand to express his
<em>astonishment</em> and <em>grief</em> to the comptroller-general, Machault.
His letter is lengthy, and skilfully written. He avoided all
mention of dogma, well aware that this kind of argument
would be of no avail with unbelievers; but he developed in
his own way the political side of the question. According
to him the Calvinists were the enemies of the king, rebels on
principle, republicans by system; they had on many occasions
brought the country within an inch of its ruin, and
would do so again if they were recalled. Louis XIV. had
the wisdom to free the body politic of the state from these
vicious and peccant humours, which had caused so many disorders
in it (we follow the text); Louis XV. will pursue the
same course. As for the thought of permitting the Huguenot
pastors to carry on their ministry in France, it was an
enormity to which the bishop would on no account agree.
“Heaven, which has ever protected the monarchy,” he says
in conclusion, “heaven, which has until now united religion
with it by a bond that has not been broken, inspired
him with this confidence. We will not witness the free
exercise of Calvinism. No, the son, the heir, the imitator
of Louis the Great, will not re-establish the Huguenots.”</p>

<p>The comptroller-general, who had no affection for the
priests, but who feared their intrigues and denunciations,
hastened to disavow the more or less apochryphal paper,
which had stirred up the bile of the bishop of Agen, and
the matter dropped. The difference of opinions and times
was here again apparent. In our days, a prelate who should
utter the sentiments of Chabannes, would be accused of insanity;
in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Bishop
Chabannes was taxed with excessive indulgence by his
brethren; he was considered much too moderate a man!</p>

<p>Monclus, bishop of Alais, indeed carried his exactions a
great deal farther. Although he confessed that persecution
does not change the heart, and that conversion is only a
work of grace, he, at the same time, in 1751, publicly
solicited a new declaration against the Protestants. He
required the entire abolition of judicial forms. The Huguenots,
who should refuse to perform the acts of Catholicity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
ought to be, according to this prelate’s notions, summarily
tried by the commandant of the province, or by the intendant.
He accused the magistrates of having relaxed the
severity of the ordinances, which was an act of unfaithfulness,
which had been the cause of all the misfortunes of the
realm. He demanded that the intervention of the Parliaments
should cease; that the military or administrative
power should be wholly uncontrolled; and that the judgments
should be arbitrary and absolute.</p>

<p>The procurator-general, at the Parliament of Aix, Rippert
de Monclar, defended religion, justice, morality, and humanity,
which had been so greatly outraged by this priest. He
replied, in a <cite>Political and Theological Memoir</cite>, published in
1755, that the sentiments of the prelate were as irreligious
as they were inhuman, and tended to the total destruction of
society. “If the bishops have any reason to complain,” he
adds, “of the profanation of the sacraments by the Protestants,
and of the uselessness of the proofs they have exacted
for seventy years past, why are they bent upon continuing
the same acts of Catholicism, by soliciting against them a
continuous and rigorous execution of royal ordinances? Why
force them in this manner to repeat this horrible impiety
which is complained of? Is it imagined that it is preferable
to tread our holy religion underfoot, than not to profess it
at all? Who believes that it is possible to force a person,
against his inclination and belief, to receive mysteries so
dread that faith alone with love and ardour ought to lead
us to approach them, and which should be avoided by
Catholics themselves, who feel the slightest coldness or indifference?
The profanations that have happened have
appalled both heaven and earth, and yet it is sought to
renew the hideous sight.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Rippert de Monclar says that these heretics were, after
all, not worse than the Jews, who were allowed not only
liberty of marriage, independently of the Church, but also
the free exercise of their religion. He asks if it were
right to embrace in one condemnation, with the hundred and
fifty thousand fathers and mothers who had contracted
clandestine marriages, the whole multitude of children born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
or to be born? “What wrong have they done,” he exclaimed,
“that they were made the opprobrium of the
land?”</p>

<p>He proves, moreover, that the persecutions sought by the
bishop of Alais, would not be more efficacious than those
which had already taken place. “If this prelate,” he says,
“were to have a correct list of all the Protestant ministers,
who have been put to death; of all the persons of every age
and degree, who have been sent to the galleys; of all the
taxes, fines, and other contributions, which have been exacted;
of all the children, who have been torn from their
parents; of all the marriages, which have been annulled and
declared public concubinages; of all the property, which has
been thereupon awarded to collateral relations; of all the
individuals, who have been imprisoned and kept in long captivity;
of all the decrees, that have been passed against an
infinity of others; even of all the excesses, and of all the
frightful massacres committed by the king’s troops, and in
opposition to the intention of his majesty; alas! this list
would fill volumes. Every corner of France re-echoes with the
cries of these miserable people; they attract the very compassion
of those who glory, I will not say in being Christians,
but in being men; and yet a bishop is insensible to all this,
and would fain redouble them! Would it not better become
him, to plant and nourish [measures] in their behalf,
and to weep between the porch and the altar for them?”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>This lesson of morality and public reproof, given by the
magistracy to the clergy, was as deserved as it was severe;
it was not the only one, as we shall have occasion to show.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_XI">XI.</h3>
</div>


<p>The government did not accede on all points to the demands
of the bishops; it neither dared nor wished [to do
so]. Nevertheless it complied with a great deal, and all the
more in that it required to recruit its finances, [which had
been] exhausted by the war. The prelates consented to
increase their voluntary donations, but under the express
condition that the extirpation of heresy should be prosecuted
with more rigour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span></p>

<p>The Protestants, for their part, did not cease by every
peaceable means to petition for the redress of their grievances.
Seven pastors of the desert addressed to Louis XV.,
on the 21st December, 1750, a new and respectful petition,
in which, after having stated that they regarded the
aggregate worship, baptisms, marriages, and sacraments
of their communion as a matter of conscience, they said:
“Your troops pursue us in the deserts as if we were wild
beasts; our property is confiscated; our children are torn
from us; we are condemned to the galleys; and although
our ministers continually exhort us to discharge our duty as
good citizens and faithful subjects, a price is set upon their
heads, and when they are taken, they are cruelly executed.”</p>

<p>Louis XV. and his council gave no heed to this petition
any more than they had done to the others. The Protestants
were in the depth of the provinces; they had neither voluntary
donations to offer to the government, nor powerful protectors
to invoke. They were regarded with suspicion from
the very fact of their being proscribed, and the injury, which
had been inflicted, was the best reason for inflicting greater
severity upon them.</p>

<p>These details of the sentiments of the court, and the incessant
provocations of the clergy, serve to explain the renewal
of the persecutions, which the Protestants endured
from 1750 to 1755. The intendant Lenain, who was
naturally a rigid man, but had treated the Protestants more
mildly, as he had become better acquainted with them, was
replaced in Languedoc by the Viscount Guignard de Saint
Priest, who, without being either fanatically or cruelly disposed,
unhesitatingly executed the most violent measures.
The meetings near Cayla, Vigan, and Anduze, were again
attacked. In the last of these encounters, three men were
killed, others wounded, and many led to prison; whilst the
pursuit was carried on with such bitter determination, that
it became necessary to renounce religious service on the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>The intendant received orders to proceed to a general <em>re-baptism</em>
of children, and to a <em>re-benediction</em> of marriages
throughout the whole Reformed population. The words [of
this order] were as barbarous as the thing itself. With this
view, he convoked the notables at Nismes and elsewhere, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
1751, and commanded them to take their children to the
parochial churches within a fortnight’s time; in default of
which they would be punished with the utmost rigour of
the ordinances; and the curates and (Roman) Catholic
consuls were directed to prepare lists of the recusants.
Guignard de Saint Priest took the trouble, ridiculous under
the circumstances, to start a chapter of controversy, like a
doctor of the Sorbonne, and to establish that (Roman)
Catholic baptism being recognised by the religionists as
effective, their rejection of it would be a <em>senseless obstinacy</em>.</p>

<p>The Protestants replied to this military controversialist,
that the curates interpreted the question quite differently;
that they exacted the promise to rear the children in the
Romish faith, that they treated and punished those of the
baptized as having relapsed, who did not remain (Roman)
Catholics, and that the clergy had made use of the following
maxim: “The Church has power over those, who receive
baptism, just as the king, neither more nor less, has full
right over the coin which he issues from his mint.”</p>

<p>Finding his reasons fail, the Viscount de Saint Priest resumed
a part better suited to his character, and pronounced
the most fearful threats against the obstinate. The oppressed
were terrified. They abandoned their houses, fields, workshops,
and factories, and fled for safety to the woods and
mountain caverns.</p>

<p>The intendants anger increased; and on the 1st of September,
1751, he wrote to one of his subordinates: “They
are mistaken if they hope that the king’s mind will change,
or that I shall omit to execute the precise orders which his
majesty has given me on the subject. I am willing, however,
to grant them a short delay.” But the desertion went
on increasing, and Saint Priest had recommenced the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>
with billets conceived in these terms: “The Sieur N.,
cavalier of the <i lang="fr">maréchaussée</i>, will remain in garrison at the
house of * * *, until he has taken his children to the
church to undergo the ceremony of baptism by the curate
of the place; and he will exact, for his pay, four livres
a day, until perfect obedience has been shown, at the same
time informing him that the garrison will be reinforced.”</p>

<p>A commandant of the name of Pontuan, or Pontual,
shouted in the streets of Cayla: “Let nobody deceive himself;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
all the Huguenots shall obey or perish, if I die myself!”
The soldiers, aided by some of the [Roman] Catholics, and
frequently accompanied by the local priests, tracked the
children about the country, seized them as if they were
malefactors, and dragged them to the church.</p>

<p>“Some,” says Antoine Court, “ten, twelve, and fourteen
years old, absolutely refused to be led to the church, and it was
necessary to drag them there by main force; some uttered
piercing shrieks that went to the heart; others threw themselves
like young lions upon those who tried to seize them;
others, again, who had no other means of showing their
despite, turned the ceremony into ridicule which they were
forced to undergo: when they were covered with a white
cloth, and the water was about to be sprinkled upon their
heads, they exclaimed: ‘Are they going to shave us?’ The
curate and the garrison of Lussan so greatly tortured the
children of the village in dragging them to the church,
where they shut them up under lock and key, that some of
them told the curate they seemed to see the devil whenever
they looked upon him, and others, still more desperate, spat
in his face.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In such a state, in the midst of these brutal and degrading
scenes, baptism was administered to them by force! If we
were told that such acts had been committed by a horde of
savages, we should scarcely believe it; and yet these things
took place in France within a century of our time!</p>

<p>When he had effected the re-baptism of Cayla, the commandant
Pontual, whose zeal increased with the gratification
he experienced in the capture of the children, continued his
expeditions throughout Vaunage, the whole length of the
coast, placing sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty garrison
soldiers in the houses of the absentees and the obstinate,
whose property they sacked and demolished.</p>

<p>The court of Versailles was rejoiced at the news of so
many re-baptized children, and ordered the work to be prosecuted
in the mountains. But this was the limit of Pontual’s
exploits. The old recollections of the Camisards were
awakened; and some of the peasantry, rather encouraged
than restrained by their minister Coste, resumed the musket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
declaring that on the first act of violence against their children,
blood should be spilled. Neither the curates nor the soldiers
heeded the menace; and in an ambush of the Cévenoles,
three priests fell on the 10th of August, 1752, two mortally
wounded, as they guided the military in an expedition into
Lédignan, on the banks of the Gardon.</p>

<p>These gunshots produced an extraordinary effect. The
soldiers evacuated the hills; the intendant stopped short;
Versailles took alarm; people remembered the war of the
Camisards; the re-baptisms were instantly abandoned, and for
ever. If the ministers of state had been fanatics, civil war
would have broken out again with all its horrors; but they
were only unbelievers who parodied, while they laughed at,
the passions of bygone generations, and they halted at the
first symptoms of a serious conflict.</p>

<p>Emigration also, which had been renewed upon a large
scale, contributed to calm their factitious anger. It was
true that the same precautions had been taken to guard the
passes as in 1685; but the Protestants had used the same
means to escape the vigilance of the soldiers. Languedoc,
Dauphiny, Saintonge, already impoverished by the Edict of
Revocation, were threatened with the loss of the last remains
of their industry and commerce. The frivolity of Versailles
retreated before this prospect.</p>

<p>A few weeks after this exhibition of insurgency, the Marquis
de Paulmy, the minister of war, visited the fortresses
of Languedoc. Being a man of prudence and integrity, he
received the complaints of the Protestants with kindness,
and forbade the subaltern officers to maltreat them.</p>

<p>A pastor, François Benezet, had been condemned to death
during the persecutions; he was executed at Montpellier, on
the 27th March, 1752. Harassed by the importunities of an
abbé, who continually cried, “You are damned; hell will
be your lot if you do not abjure;” he replied, “If you were
persuaded that there is a hell, would you persecute me as
you do? And should I have been condemned to lose my
life upon the gallows, merely because I have addressed a few
exhortations to my brethren?”</p>

<p>He endeavoured to speak at the foot of the gibbet; as
usual, his voice was drowned by the noise of drums. He
died singing the 51st Psalm. Benezet left behind him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
a child of two years old, and a pregnant wife. Like Louis
Ranc and Désubas, he was only twenty-six years old.</p>

<p>Another pastor, Jean Molines, did not display the same
courage. He abjured before the scaffold; but until his last
moment he repented his weakness. He withdrew, inconsolable,
to Holland; and although he was reinstated in the
communion of the faithful, after having given proofs of profound
remorse, he never forgave himself. An eyewitness
relates, that his countenance, furrowed with wrinkles, bore
the imprint of despair. His sight was dimmed with tears;
and his head hung heavily upon his breast. For thirty years
he wandered about insensible to everything around him, as
one who reckoned himself no longer among the living, and
died with the one regret of not having won the crown of
martyrdom.</p>

<p>While he was in prison, some priests published a <cite>Letter
and Abjuration of the Sieur Molines</cite>, in his name. The Protestants
answered this work of pious fraud: “We cannot
conceive how his converters can have let him date his abjuration
from the citadel of Montpellier. A fortress has never
yet been a school of enlightenment, or a means of convincing
people of the truth of religion. Every retractation that
comes from a fettered hand is so eminently suspicious, that
no one would dare to adduce it before a tribunal.”</p>

<p>We have yet to traverse the epoch of general persecutions,
particularly in the province of Languedoc; happily, it
was but of short duration, and it was the last.</p>

<p>The author of these new persecutions was a nobleman
celebrated for adventures of gallantry, the most brilliant
epicurean of the eighteenth century, an unbeliever, who protected
Voltaire, and whom Voltaire extolled,—in a word, the
Marshal de Richelieu. Assuredly, of all the parts he could
play, not one became him so little as that of an inquisitor
of faith.</p>

<p>As governor of Languedoc he had for some time shown a
degree of kindness to the religionists; but on a sudden, in
the month of February, 1754, he ordered a proclamation, or
instruction to the military commandants, to be placarded in
the principal towns and villages of the dioceses of Montpellier,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
Nismes, Uzès, and Alais, which re-awakened all the alarms
of the Protestants. The marshal did not mention re-baptism;
that affair had been too unsuccessful in its results;
but he pointed now at the meetings of the desert, and threatened
to apply the most rigorous dispositions of the Edict of
1724 against them.</p>

<p>Orders were issued to arrest the new converts, and refugees
or suspected persons, who came from foreign countries
without an express authorization. The meetings were to be
watched with the greatest tenacity, and dispersed by force.
As many prisoners were to be made as possible; particularly
the preachers were to be seized, and shot if they attempted
to fly, and no one was to be released until further orders. A
reward of a thousand crowns was promised to any one who
should capture a minister, and orders were given to arrest
whomsoever should be found in the same house with him.</p>

<p>When this proclamation appeared, people asked what had
provoked it. A tacit toleration had been established since
the affair of Lédignan. The confidence of the Reformed
had returned. They assembled peaceably, with very little
mystery, but without ostentation, in the depth of some
valley, or upon the heights of their mountains. Their relations
with the [Roman] Catholics became more easy; agriculture,
industry, commerce, the revenues of the states,
everything gained by it. Wherefore, then, this new appeal
to brutal force?</p>

<p>This has never been well known. The ill humour of a
minister of state, some pressing letters of the clergy, the
caprice or the vanity of a governor, who flattered himself
that he would by ingenious combinations terminate a struggle
that had lasted eighty years,—any of these things sufficed
in those times to renew the persecution. But if the Duke
de Richelieu had hoped to terminate the struggle by means
of a strategetical plan, he was deceived. The courtier of
Louis XV. judged of the conscience of the Protestants by
his own.</p>

<p>Some meetings were immediately suspended, others were
attacked. The prisons were filled; the tower of Aigues-Mortes
received a further number of unfortunate females;
but the greater number of the people would not submit.
Richelieu reported his difficulties at Versailles, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
Count de Saint Florentin sent him an answer, that “The
king’s judgment was, that it was absolutely imperative they
should be sickened of their taste for assemblies.” This was
an easy sentence to pen in a despatch; but the <em>taste for
assemblies</em>, inherent in every sincere faith, was even stronger
than the will of Louis XV.</p>

<p>The Protestants simply redoubled the precautions, with
which they sought to hold their religious meetings. They
procured information as to the days and hours of the troops’
excursions, the direction they took, the number of the
soldiers on service, and the character, more or less rigorous,
of the commanding officer. The faithful were warned
even by (Roman) Catholics, who were ashamed of these
brutalities, or, on the first signal of alarm, they dispersed.
If, however, they were surprised, despite their precautious
measures to ensure safety, their hearts accepted the suffering
as a divine trial.</p>

<p>It was in one of these attacks upon the meetings that
Jean Fabre, a Protestant of Nismes, supplicated a commander
of a detachment to put him in prison in the stead of his
father, an old man of seventy-eight. The governor of the
province sent the pious son off to the convict prison of
Toulon, considering, it would seem, that the Huguenots did
not belong to the human race; and it was only when the
drama of the <em>Honest Convict</em> informed the court, the ministers,
France, and Europe, of this act of treason against humanity,
and when Jean Fabre had worn the chains of the galley-slave
for seven weary years, that he was restored to his family.</p>

<p>All the other surprises of meetings offer a repetition of
the same enormities, and we will cite that only which happened
in Lower Languedoc on the 8th of August, 1756.
Three young men were to be ordained to the ministry of the
Gospel at this assembly. The solemnity had collected several
pastors, and attracted a vast concourse of people; as many
as from ten to twelve thousand had come from the whole
surrounding country. They were singing a psalm, when a
detachment of fifteen or eighteen soldiers made their appearance,
hastening musket in hand to the spot. The multitude,
although unarmed, might have crushed this handful of
assailants by their very weight; but the pastors always
preached patience and submission. The crowd leaped to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
their feet, and precipitately fled in all directions. The troop
fired upon them,—every shot told; and while some fell dead,
and others wounded, the rest escaped uttering shrieks of
terror and grief; only a few stood their ground, and endeavoured
to defend their wives and children with stones. The
murderers remained masters of the field, and a long track
of blood marked the locality of this prayer-meeting. Do
we relate a scene of the age of Louis XV., or one of the
time of Innocent III. and Simon de Montfort?</p>

<p>Another pastor perished in this deplorable epoch. Etienne
Teissier, whose surname of the desert was Lafage, was
arrested near Castres, at the farmhouse of a Protestant
named Jacques Novis. On the approach of the troops, he
endeavoured to escape over the roof; but a gun-shot broke
his arm and wounded him in the chin. All the persons in
the house were arrested with him, and among them a woman
and two young girls. The prisoners followed the guards
singing the psalms of the desert-meetings.</p>

<p>Lafage was taken to the prison of Alais. “The Abbé
Ricard, canon of Alais, after showing the prisoner the
greatest marks of politeness, thought proper to lead off a
controversial discussion; and it was not until the unfortunate
minister declared that he had not the strength to discuss,
that he was nearly mortally wounded, and that his
only desire was to prepare himself for his approaching end,
that he was relieved from the importunities of the priest.
Several of the faithful, however, were admitted to the consolation
of visiting the martyr. Even his father and one of
his brothers were allowed to see him; and he implored them,
to pray for him, but to submit themselves with holy resignation
to the decrees of Providence; he assured them,
besides, that he was resolved to suffer everything for the
cause of the Gospel.... On his arrival at Montpellier,
the trial of the minister was arranged and consummated
with barbarous rapidity. The unhappy pastor, already
dangerously wounded by the fire of the troops, was fastened
to the gibbet, which did not, any more than the preparations
for the execution, disturb the serenity of his soul. The
soldiers who encompassed the scaffold, could not restrain
their tears at the aspect of this last sacrifice of a faith so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
intrepid. The sentence of death was pronounced by Guignard
de Saint Priest, the intendant.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>This administrator condemned also, upon his own authority,
Jacques Novis as contumacious, sentenced him to perpetual
imprisonment at the galleys, confiscated two-thirds of
his property, ordered that his house should be razed to the
ground (a house razed in 1754 for having sheltered a pastor!),
and released his wife and three children, who were well-nigh
reduced to beg their bread. All this was done without the
intervention of any judge, by the mere sentence of a commissioner;
the form of justice was not less outraged than
justice itself.</p>

<p>And this act, which would now rouse the indignation of
all France,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> was not an isolated or exceptional iniquity.
The other provinces, although treated with more caution
than Languedoc, because they did not contain so many
religionists, were not without their share of sufferings and
victims.</p>

<p>In Saintonge, the Protestants assembled in barns or remote
buildings, because the inclemency of the climate would
not easily permit them to celebrate their worship in the
open air. Whereupon, one day, the intendant ordered the
demolition of these places of service to the very last, and
sentenced to detention for life at the galleys a poor man, who
had allowed meetings to be held in his house. A woman
was condemned to perpetual confinement on the bare suspicion
of having given asylum to the pastor Gibert; and
this very pastor, happily contumacious, was condemned, on
the sentence of the intendant, to be hanged, after humbly
kneeling before the principal door of a (Roman) Catholic church.
His nephew, compelled to be present at the execution, was
then sent to the galleys, with a number of Protestants, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
had been convicted of having accompanied the minister in
his excursions. This took place in 1756.</p>

<p>In the county of Montauban, the soldiers committed brutalities,
which did not always pass without an effusion of
blood, and the Parliament of Toulouse conceived the idea of
enjoining all persons who had been married in the desert, to
separate immediately, under pain of fine and corporal punishment.
This wrought the dissolution of thousands of families
at a single blow, or constrained them to purchase the
benediction of the priest by sacrilegious acts of (Roman)
Catholicism. The Protestants refused to submit, but they
had to suffer every kind of trouble and anguish in their
homes. The decree of the Parliament made hundreds of
people miserable, but none of them (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>The province of Béarn, once so oppressed, the first of the
provinces where Louis XIII. had forcibly reinstalled the
(Roman) Catholic religion, and where Louvois organized the
expeditions of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>, encountered fresh calamities
in 1757 and 1758. The governor put his troops at the disposal
of the clergy. The Protestants of Orthez, Salies, and
Bellocq fled to the mountains, and more than one hundred
persons were proclaimed for capture dead or alive. The
curates were generally extremely exacting in the proofs
they required from the religionists. Those of Orthez, besides
the gifts of large amount, which it was necessary to guarantee
in the presence of the notary, made those who had
been espoused wait one year, and sometimes two years, before
they would give the nuptial benediction. In one case the
curate imposed a delay of twelve years.</p>

<p>In Guienne, the Reformed of Sainte Foy, Bergerac, Tonneins,
Clairac, and other places, were forced to maintain
dragoons, to pay fines, to suffer vexations of every kind;
nor were the ideas of re-baptism and re-benediction yet
abandoned there in 1758.</p>

<p>The Parliament of Bordeaux (it is true that Montesquieu
was there no longer), reprinted the declaration of 1724, sent
it to all the curates of the district to be publicly read, and
in the month of November, 1757, passed a decree commanding
all those who had been married by ministers, <em>or even by
any other ecclesiastics than their own curates</em>, to separate
immediately; prohibiting them from conversing under pain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
of exemplary punishment; branding their cohabitation with
the name of concubinage; declaring their children illegitimate,
and, as such, incapable of direct succession; lastly,
commanding fathers, mothers, and guardians to send their
children to the (Roman) Catholic schools, and to be catechized
until they were fourteen years old, and to the Sunday
and feast-day teachings until the age of twenty.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>To crown these tyrannical proceedings, this decree was
published for several days on the Exchange of Bordeaux,
where the most eminent of the Protestants were met: “a
circumstance,” says a petition which we have before us,
“that materially injured their credit in their commercial
transactions on one hand; and that, on the other, tended to
make them an object of hatred or of contempt to the lower
orders of the people, always extreme in their opinions and
heedless in their proceedings.”</p>

<p>The petitioners further said, “We do not regret either
office or honours; it is with your majesty to dispense them
to whomsoever you please; but we claim the rights that we
derive from nature, and which every religion should hold
sacred. It must be no longer hidden from you: there are,
sire, more than fifty thousand marriages that will fall within
the scope of the decree of the Parliament of Bordeaux; and
among these marriages, there are some of so old a date as to
have given birth to ten or twelve children. Behold, sire,
what a multitude of citizens are reduced in one instant to
despair!”</p>

<p>Lastly, the Protestants took up the political question:
“When a neighbouring state, jealous of the prosperity of
our armies, vainly sought, last September, to penetrate into
Saintonge and Aunis, what class of your subjects showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
more zeal than the Protestants to repel the presumptuous
enemy? Your generals did them justice in this respect.
Are not your armies and your navy at this present moment
filled with soldiers, officers, and sailors of the Reformed religion,
distinguished not less for their unshaken fidelity than
for their bravery?” (3rd January, 1758.)</p>

<p>This petition did not prevent the decree of the Parliament
of Bordeaux from being followed by cruel iniquities. The
seneschal of Nérac condemned five Protestants to the galleys,
one of whom was an old man of eighty. Numbers of others
were thrust into the prisons of Guienne, Périgord, and
Agenois. The Reformed of Sainte Foy and Bergerac had
to pay upwards of forty thousand livres, besides the losses
they sustained through the soldiers billeted upon them.
And yet the authorities had not the courage to execute the
decree in its entirety; the rich merchants of Bordeaux had
pronounced the word “emigration” in their complaints, and
the interest of the treasury procured for them that which
had been refused by the fanatic bigotry of the priests and
the despotism of the court.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_XIII">XIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>Until now we have delayed to mention the venerable pastor
Paul Rabaut, because he belongs to two epochs, and his
long career connects him both with the times of persecution
and those of toleration. During half a century, Paul Rabaut
has afforded the most elevated, and the most perfect type of
a true servant of Jesus Christ. He was firm and courageous,
yet cautious, and as inflexible in matters of religion as he was
submissive in purely civil affairs; and this rare union of qualities
justly entitled him to the greatest influence over the
churches of the desert.</p>

<p>Paul Rabaut was born on the 9th of January, 1718, at
Bédarieux, near Montpellier, of an honest family of traders,
who delighted in sheltering the proscribed pastors. It was
in his conversations with them that he felt himself animated
with a desire for the evangelical ministry, or, as Antoine
Court would have said, for the vocation of martyrdom. He
was grave, studious, and, beyond all, pious, which procured
him the surname of “<em>the minister of Charenton</em>” from his
schoolmaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span></p>

<p>From the age of sixteen he became, with his friend Jean
Pradel, the companion of the desert ministers. He shared
their labours, and imitated their patience. Rejoiced that he
suffered with them for the sake of his Divine Master, he
undertook, without having the title or the office of pastor,
to instruct his brethren, reading the Bible at the meetings,
exhorting the faithful in their domestic circles, encouraging
some, comforting others, and setting an example to all.</p>

<p>But this noviciate, however dear it might be, was insufficient.
The churches wanted pastors capable of opposing the
aberrations within and the objections without, with a sound
and intelligent theology. Paul Rabaut perceived this, and
in 1740 he went to study in the seminary at Lausanne.
Antoine Court received him as a son, and his discernment
soon marked the young disciple out as the man most fitted
to succeed him in the government of the flocks of the wilderness.</p>

<p>On his return in 1743 he was appointed pastor of Nismes,
and from this early moment, he took the lofty position which
he occupied until his death in 1795. His colleagues reposed
implicit confidence in him, and never failed to consult him
on all difficult occasions. His abode, which was often but a
hut of piled stones, became the centre of Protestant affairs.
All the faithful respected him, and when persecution began
to rage anew, they instinctively turned towards him, as sailors
fix their look upon the lighthouse signal in a storm.</p>

<p>Every one knew the devotion with which he had embraced
the pastoral office, and that he had no other object than the
welfare of religion. A letter, which he addressed to the
intendant Lenain in 1746, will show how he himself explained
this: “When I resolved upon exercising the ministry in this
kingdom, I knew well to what I exposed myself; and, indeed,
I have always considered myself a victim destined to
death. I believed that I was doing the greatest good in my
power, by devoting myself to the pastor’s calling. Since the
Protestants are deprived of the free exercise of their religion,
since they think it wrong for them to attend the services of
the (Roman) Catholic religion, since they cannot procure the
books they require for their instruction, you may judge, sir,
what would be their condition, if they were absolutely deprived
of pastors. They would forget their most essential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
duties; they would fall, either into fanaticism—that fruitful
source of extravagance and disorders—or into indifference
and contempt for religion altogether.”</p>

<p>Paul Rabaut, whom the law condemned to death, contributed
more than any one to dissuade the Protestant population
from desperate counsels, and, perhaps, no Frenchman
throughout the whole eighteenth century has been more useful
to his country. Not only in the synods, where he maintained
the authority of a wise discipline, but also in private
interviews and conversations with individuals, he continually
and unceasingly recommended obedience to the laws and the
magistrates, never admitting an exception whatsoever but
the conscientious worship of God.</p>

<p>We read in his letters that he always, and with all his power,
strove to prevent the religionists from bringing weapons to
the assemblies. In the melancholy affair of the pastor
Désubas, when thousands of the peasantry vowed to avenge
the blood of their brethren slaughtered at Vernoux, he invoked
religion, humanity, the duty of submission, and whatever
is of most avail in faith and Christian law, to induce
them to disarm. He did this again in the insurrection that
had begun on the borders of the Gardon, at the time of the
general re-baptizement.</p>

<p>He wrote to the leaders in the province, on this head:
“When I desired to know whence the evil proceeded, I
found that divers persons, seeing themselves threatened
either with loss of their property and their freedom, or by
compulsion to perform acts opposed to their conscience, with
reference to their marriages or the baptism of their children,
and perceiving no opportunity of quitting the kingdom and
freeing their conscience, gave themselves up to despair and
attacked some priests, because they regarded them as the
first and principal cause of their troubles. Once again, I
blame these folks, but I thought it my duty to explain to
you the cause of their despair. If it be thought that my
ministry is necessary to calm the minds of the people, I will
undertake the task with pleasure. Above all, if I could
satisfy the Protestants of these parts that they will not be
molested in their conscience, I would earnestly recommend
the mass to stop those who are bent on rising, should there
be any so minded.” (21st August, 1752.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span></p>

<p>It is thus that he obtained the esteem of the (Roman)
Catholics as well as the respect of the Reformed. People
were confident that he would decide all religious questions
with that wise moderation, which, without detracting from the
obligations of faith, would never unreasonably provoke the
severity of power.</p>

<p>When the minister of war passed through Languedoc, Rabaut
had the boldness to present a petition to him for the king.
This happened on the 19th September, 1752, between
Nismes and Montpellier. While he waited at a post-house
for a change of horses, the Marquis de Paulmy perceived a
stranger respectfully approaching him, with a paper in his
hand. Rabaut introduced himself by name: the minister knew
him to be the proscribed pastor, and might have ordered his
arrest, and even summary execution, according to the letter
of the ordinances. But impressed with admiration at the
noble bearing of the pastor, he bowed and accepted the
petition, which he promised to lay before the king. It is
ascertained that he kept his word.</p>

<p>The intendant of Languedoc also refused to seize the
person of Rabaut, for the reason that the trial and execution
of the venerated pastor would have convulsed the whole
province. As this officer, however, entertained the idea,
that the religious meetings would cease to be held, on the
departure of the minister, he used every effort to make him
quit the realm: sometimes he offered to release a certain
number of prisoners, as the price of his expatriation; sometimes
he persecuted his wife, Madeleine Gaidan, whose name
deserves to be associated with that of her husband. She
never gave such advice as might be expected from the weakness
of her sex, and preferred leading a wandering and uncertain
life with her aged mother and her children, rather
than urge Rabaut to quit the post, which God had allotted to
him. The Duke de Mirepoix was ashamed of these unworthy
molestations, and allowed Madeleine Gaidan to
return to Nismes, after a lapse of two years of persecution.</p>

<p>Paul Rabaut, however, was not the less liable to the
rigour of the ordinances, which decreed sentence of death
against the pastors. “For more than thirty years,” says one
of his biographers, “caverns and huts, whence he was unearthed
like a wild animal, were his only habitation. For a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
long time lie dwelt in a safe hiding-place that one of his
faithful guides had provided for him, under a pile of stones
and thorn-bushes. It was discovered at length by a shepherd,
and such was the wretchedness of his condition, that
when he was forced to abandon the place, he still regretted
this retreat [which was] more fit for savage beasts than men.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>He assumed all sorts of disguises and names, like the (Roman)
Catholic priests during the Reign of Terror. At one
time it was M. Paul, at another, M. Denis, or M. Pastourel,
or M. Théophile, on his way to perform the functions of his
ministry under the garb of a trader, or a journeyman baker.</p>

<p>It is difficult to picture to oneself the extent of his
labours. He wrote to one of his friends at Geneva, in 1755,
that being occupied all day with a multitude of affairs, he
was often obliged to work far into the night; then, he said,
with that humility which characterizes eminent men: “When
I fix my attention upon the divine fire with which, I will
not say Jesus Christ and the apostles, but the Reformed and
their immediate successors, burned for the salvation of souls,
it seems to me that, in comparison with them, we are ice.
Their immense works astound me, and at the same time
cover me with confusion. What would I not give to resemble
them in everything laudable!”</p>

<p>What was indeed a singular novelty in this time of disorder—he
entered into a correspondence with a prince of the
blood, from the depth of his retreat. The influence of
philosophical ideas, the desire of taking one of the causes of
the opposition in hand, or perhaps the mere heaviness of
idleness, engaged the Prince de Conti to interest himself in
the fate of the Protestants. He sought information from
Paul Rabaut, and invited him to a conference. The pastor
of the desert started secretly for Paris, in the month of July,
1755.</p>

<p>He had two interviews with the prince, and stated the
following points: “That the galley convicts and prisoners
sentenced on account of their religion, and the children of
both sexes shut up in the convents and seminaries, should be
set at liberty; that baptisms and marriages celebrated by
the (Protestant) ministers should be valid, under condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
of being registered in offices established by the king; that
the exercise of religion should be permitted, if not in the
places of worship, at least in private houses at some distance
from the towns and villages; finally, that every one should
be allowed to sell his property without any special authority,
and that the refugees should have the right of returning to
the realm.”</p>

<p>These demands were assuredly moderate enough. [What
they asked for] was far from full freedom of religion; it was
not even toleration to any great extent. The (Roman)
Catholics of Ireland have never at any time had less; and
they already enjoyed much more in the eighteenth century.
The Prince de Conti, however, did not consider that there
was any chance of obtaining so much from the council and
the clergy, and these negotiations had no result.</p>

<p>Paul Rabaut returned to his labours in Languedoc. The
author from whom we have already quoted, gives the following
description of him: “He was short of stature; his complexion
was dark; his physiognomy and demeanour mild;
lois manner grave, yet affable; and his habits simple and
patriarchal. His food was of the most sober kind. His
powers of endurance were remarkable. The hard and
wandering life he had been forced to lead from his youth
upwards, in following a proscribed faith, had strengthened
his constitution; but his unceasing devotion to his flock had
injured and undermined his vigour, and seriously affected
him in his old age.”</p>

<p>People flocked from all parts to hear him preach. Another
biographer says: “We are told that his audience sometimes
comprised from ten to twelve thousand of the faithful.
But his voice was so distinct and sonorous that although [he
preached] in the open air, it reached those at the greatest distance,
and all could take home with them the useful lessons of
the pastor. He prayed with a fervour and an unction that
penetrated every bosom, and disposed hearts the least prepared
to listen to the sermon. He frequently preached without
preparation, and his wild and uncultured eloquence
seemed even to grow in sublimity.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Some of the manuscript sermons of Paul Rabaut have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
been preserved. It is said that they are not distinguished
either for oratorical genius or for studious finish: the venerable
pastor had neither leisure nor opportunity. But they
are remarkable for order, mildness, perspicuity, and unction:
his style was of that simple and paternal kind which suited
the meetings of the wilderness.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_XIV">XIV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The approach of the year 1760 witnessed a sensible
relaxation of persecution. The laws of intolerance were
not, indeed, abrogated, but they were relaxed by desuetude;
for knowledge, public opinion, the interest of the state,
the relations of commerce and society, tended every day to
approximate the (Roman) Catholics to the Protestants. The
differences of confession were rapidly disappearing before the
common name and quality of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The clergy perceived this with dismay, and in their general
assembly of 1760, they addressed urgent remonstrances to
the king against this remission of the laws: “Nearly every
barrier opposed to Calvinism,” they said, “has been successively
broken down. Ministers and preachers, reared in
heretical schools and foreign nations, have inundated some
of our provinces. They have held consistories and synods,
and are constantly presiding over assemblies, sometimes
secret, sometimes solemn. They baptize, administer the [the
Lord’s] supper, preach their erroneous doctrines, and perform
the marriage ceremony. At first the Calvinists only demanded
the power of celebrating their marriages in a purely civil and
profane form; and although they feigned to limit themselves
to this permission, it was evident that it would, of itself, lead
to the entire toleration of Calvinism. Now this toleration
is openly and loudly preached!”</p>

<p>Toleration, it would hence appear, was in the eyes of the
priests, an impious and immoral maxim. Their sayings
were unheeded, and the nation kept the even tenor of its
new way.</p>

<p>Military and civil authorities, governors, intendants, subordinates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
officers, magistrates, were alike ashamed, both before
the tribunal of their own conscience and that of public
opinion, of persecuting individuals whom they were compelled
to esteem as men of honour and good citizens. Rulhières
cites some curious instances of this: “Even the
troops,” he says “softened the inhumanity of the orders they
had to execute. The officers slackened the march of their
detachments, that the assembled religionists might have time
to escape. They took care that a sufficient warning should
precede their approach; and they purposely followed circuitous
roads, to throw their soldiers off the scent.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the Protestants were still summoned by official
means, to return to the strict execution of the edicts: but
this was nothing more than the last discharge of artillery
after a lost battle.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1761, the Marshal de Thomond, who had been
appointed to the government of Languedoc, commanded
the religionists to reverse their marriages and the baptisms
of their children within six days. This order caused much
astonishment, but no dismay. No one feared any serious
conflict, and the simple force of <em>inertia</em> effectively defeated
the measure; whilst the marshal himself undertook the charge
of transmitting the petitions of the pastors to Louis XV.
In three months the whole affair was forgotten.</p>

<p>Two synods were convoked in Lower Languedoc, in the
year 1760. One comprised twenty pastors and fifty-four
elders; the other fifteen pastors and thirty-eight elders.
These gatherings were not publicly announced, but neither
were they held in secret; appearances were preserved, though
the law was disregarded.</p>

<p>Gradually, as persecution relaxed, the language of the
leaders of the churches became more resolute, as might be
expected. Paul Rabaut and his colleague, Paul Vincent, in
1761, addressed a pastoral letter to the Reformed of Nismes,
exhorting them to abstain from the <em>slightest act of adhesion
to the Church of Rome</em>. They were no longer to assist at
mass, to have their marriages blessed by the priest, or their
children baptized at the (Roman) Catholic church, even when
the curates remitted altogether their exactions; they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
enjoined to be entirely and constantly faithful to the practices
of the Reformed faith. The pastors were true to their duty
in imposing these injunctions; they could not require less,
since it is of the essence of every religion to be sufficient for
the wants of its own members. The Romish clergy did the
same thing after the 9th Thermidor.</p>

<p>The meetings became more regular; they were held nearer
and nearer to the towns and villages; for <em>proximity</em>, to use
the customary phrase, largely increased the number of assistants.
These meetings were held in some places under the
eye of the magistrates. The Protestants of Nismes performed
their religious services within cannon-shot of the citadel, and
those of Montauban in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Dating from 1755, the religionists confined at Toulon, the
captives detained in the different provinces of the kingdom,
and the prisoners of the tower of Constance, began to be set
at liberty with greater facility, but only one by one, and frequently,
it must be confessed, through the intervention of
foreign influences, or by means of ransom. The liberation
of a religious convict was effected for nothing, on a letter
from Voltaire, or some Protestant prince; otherwise, it cost
a thousand crowns; and afterwards, two thousand livres;
the rate of ransom gradually lowering with the advance of
public morals. Yet in 1759 there were forty-one prisoners
still confined at the galleys, whose only crime was that they
had been present at a desert meeting, or had sheltered a
pastor.</p>

<p>This improved condition was, however, disturbed in a horrible
manner by the capital execution of four persons in one
case, and of a venerable old man in another. It was the sad
privilege of the town of Toulouse, which had erected the first
scaffold against the disciples of the Reformation in 1532, to
spill the last blood on account of an heretical offence in 1762.</p>

<p>Toulouse, which has made a considerable advance in
enlightenment since this period, was at that time almost
altogether wanting in intelligence and commercial spirit.
It was filled with nobles and Parliament men, who had bent
beneath the servile yoke of their traditional prejudices. By
their side swarmed legions of priests and monks, more
Spanish than French, who kept up an abject superstition by
then processions, their relics, and their confraternities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
Below them vegetated an ignorant and fanatic people.
Every year the Church pompously celebrated at Toulouse the
commemoration of the great southern massacre of Saint
Bartholomew in 1562; and Toulouse was the stage of the
last executions.</p>

<p>François Rochette, a pastor, aged twenty-five years, who
performed the service of the numerous churches of Quercy,
had gone to recruit his exhausted health by means of the
mineral waters of Saint Antonin. He was invited, on the
road, to administer baptism, and while crossing the country
in the neighbourhood of Caussade, during the night of the
13th of September, 1761, was arrested with the two peasants
who were acting as his guides. They were suspected of belonging
to a band of robbers who infested the province. The mistake
was soon perceived; and as Rochette was not surprised
in the exercise of his functions, he might easily have
escaped by concealing his profession. Those, who interrogated
him went even so far as to point out to him this
means of acquittal, but he refused to buy his deliverance by
the least disavowal of truth.</p>

<p>The morning spread the news of his arrest with the rapidity
of lightning through the whole country. The sorrowing
and anxious Protestants assembled together, and
urgently solicited the liberation of their pastor. A fair was
held that day at Caussade, and the town was crowded with
people. The (Roman) Catholics conceived the notion that
the Huguenots had flown to arms, and intended a universal
massacre. The tocsin was sounded on every side; the villages
rose <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, and the (Roman) Catholic peasantry
stuck a white cross in their hats, in imitation of the assassins
of Saint Bartholomew. The night of the 14th was spent in
casting bullets, preparing cartouches, and many a curate
joined in and hastened the arming. The next day, the whole
population was on the alert, ready for the direst excesses,
and it was with the utmost difficulty the magistrates could
restrain them.</p>

<p>Three brothers named Grenier, glass-manufacturers in the
county of Foix, happened to be at this time in Montauban.
Hearing that the pastor Rochette had been arrested, that
the Protestants were threatened with attack, and that a
terrible contest was imminent, they hastened to the spot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
danger, with the first arms they could snatch up in their
haste, a sword and two guns. They were pursued, butchers’
dogs were put upon their track, and at length they were
captured and dragged to the prison of Rochette.</p>

<p>The Parliament of Toulouse took cognizance of the matter,
as if it were an affair of state, and the trial was conducted
with the most glaring partiality. Paul Rabaut and his
companions, astounded with a severity so long forgotten,
fruitlessly petitioned the Duke de Richelieu, the Duke de
Fitz-James, and Marie-Adelaide de France. The accused
sent long justificatory memorials to the court in vain. A
sentence, passed on the 18th of February, 1762, condemned
François Rochette to death, as convicted of having exercised
the functions of a Protestant minister, and the three brothers
Grenier, as guilty of armed sedition. The other accused,
who were poor peasants that had never committed the
shadow of a crime, were condemned to the galleys.</p>

<p>When the sentence was read to Rochette and his three
fellow-sufferers, they exclaimed with one voice, “Well! since
we must die, let us beseech God to accept the sacrifice we
offer Him.” The pastor prayed with his friends, and the
court wept at the sight.</p>

<p>Four curates came to exhort them to abjure, and one of
them threatened the religionists with hell, if they persisted
in their heresy. “We are about to appear,” replied the
pastor, “before a more equitable judge than you, even before
Him who shed His blood for our salvation.”</p>

<p>They spent their time in prayer and pious exhortations,
and encouraged each other for the final struggle. All the
assistants, sentries, and gaolers, were moved at their calm
and noble resignation. Rochette, seeing a soldier more concerned
than the rest of his comrades, said to him, “My
friend, are you not ready to die for the king; why then
should you grieve that I should die for God?”</p>

<p>The curates renewed their efforts to proselytize. “It is
for your salvation,” said they, “that we are here.” The
answer of one of the prisoners was, “If you were at Geneva,
ready to die in your bed (for no one is slain there on account
of his religion), would you be pleased if four ministers came,
under the pretence of zeal, to persecute you until your last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
breath? Do not, then, unto others that which you would
not wish to be done unto yourselves.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of February, at two o’clock in the afternoon,
the mournful procession started on its way. Rochette was,
according to the terms of the sentence, bareheaded, barefooted,
with a halter hung about his neck, from which,
before and behind, labels were suspended, with these words,
<em>Minister of the pretended Reformed religion</em>.</p>

<p>When the array passed before the church of Saint Etienne,
an attempt was made to force him, in pursuance of the terms
of the Parliament’s condemnation, to kneel with a torch of
yellow wax in his hand, and to ask pardon of God, the king,
and justice, for all his crimes and misdeeds.</p>

<p>Rochette stepped down from the tumbril, and instead of
abjuring or making a confession which his heart denied, he
pronounced on his knees the following words: “I beseech
God to pardon me for all my sins, and I firmly believe that
they have been washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ,
who has redeemed us so dearly. I have no pardon to ask of
the king, whom I have ever honoured as the Lord’s anointed,
and loved as the father of my native land; I have ever been a
good and faithful subject, and of this I believe my judges to be
convinced. I have always preached to my flock patience,
obedience, and submission; and my sermons, which you
possess, are summed up in these words, ‘<em>Fear God, honour
the king</em>.’ If I have contravened the law touching religious
assemblies, it was by God’s commandments I contravened
them; God must be obeyed before men. As for justice and
the law, I am guilty of no offence against them, and I pray
God may pardon my judges.”</p>

<p>Every door, balcony, window, roof, and approach near
to the place of execution, was covered with spectators.
“Toulouse,” says Count de Gébelin, an eyewitness, who
related these circumstances, “Toulouse, that city drunk with
the blood of martyrs, seemed a Protestant town. People
asked what was the creed of these heretics; and when they
heard our martyrs speak of Jesus Christ and of his death,
every one was surprised and afflicted. They were infinitely
touched, also, with the lofty, yet mild bearing of the three
brothers, which compelled their admiration almost as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
as the inexpressible serenity of the minister, whose graceful
and spiritual physiognomy, whose words full of firmness and
courage, and whose youth, filled every beholder with interest,
knowing, as all did, that he only died because he disdained to
save his life by a lie.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Rochette was executed first. He exhorted his companions
until the end, and sang the canticle of the Protestant martyrs:
<em>This is the blessed day</em>. “Die a Catholic,” said the
executioner, moved with pity. “Judge which is the better
religion,” replied Rochette, “that which persecutes, or that
which is persecuted.”</p>

<p>The youngest of the three brothers (he was only twenty-two
years of age), hid his face in his hands to shut out this
tragic scene. The two others contemplated it with calmness.
As they were gentlemen,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> their sentence was, to be
beheaded They embraced each other, recommending their
souls to God. The eldest offered his head to the axe first.
When it came to the turn of the last, the executioner said:
“You have seen your brothers die; change, lest you perish
like them.” “Do thy duty,” said the martyr, and his head
rolled upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>Count de Gébelin adds, as he concludes his recital: “Every
one present returned home in silence, in a state of consternation,
and unable to persuade themselves that there could
be such courage and such cruelty in the world; and I, who
describe it, cannot refrain from tears of joy and sadness, as
I contemplate their blessed lot, and that our church should
be still capable of affording examples of piety and firmness
that will compare with the most illustrious monuments of
the primitive church.”</p>

<p>Eighteen days afterwards, on the 9th of March, 1762, the
scaffold rose again at Toulouse for the execution of Jean Calas,
an old man of sixty-eight. The whole world is familiar with
his trial, and all its circumstances. Every one knows that
the unfortunate Calas was accused of having murdered his son,
Marc-Anthony, in order to prevent him, it was said, from embracing
(Roman) Catholicism. Every one knows that the priests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
of Toulouse inflamed the fanaticism of the populace by carrying
the body of this young man in procession, who had really
committed suicide, and by representing him upon a funereal
bier as a skeleton holding in one hand a scroll, on which was
written, <em>abjuration of heresy</em>, and in the other the palm-branch
of the martyr. Every one, in short, knows that the
magistracy and the clergy accused Calvin and his disciples of
declaring abjuration a lawful cause of infanticide, and pretended
that the assassination of Calas had been decided in a
conventicle of Protestants.</p>

<p>These calumnies, which were not less stupid than detestable,
were so credited by the fanatic people, that the advocate of
Calas thought it necessary to procure from Geneva a solemn
declaration, signed by the pastors and professors, attesting
that neither synod nor any assembly whatsoever of the Reformation
had ever approved of the doctrine that a father
has the right of killing his child to prevent his changing his
religion. Paul Rabaut published under this head, <cite lang="fr">La Calumnie
confondue</cite> (“Calumny Confounded”), a work in which
he denied these execrable allegations with all the vehemence
of a mind profoundly indignant. The Parliament of Toulouse
answered it by ordering that the book should be torn
and burned by the hand of the hangman.</p>

<p>In the most horrible agonies of the torture, Calas made no
avowal, for he had none to make. He continually repeated:
“Where there is no crime, there are no accomplices.” He
suffered death with the serenity of innocence and the firmness
of faith. His execution lasted two hours, his sentence
having been to be broken on the wheel. He uttered all the
while no words but those of piety and charity, breathing
pardon to his judges, and expressive of his pain that the
young Lavaïsse should have been implicated in his misfortunes.</p>

<p>Father Bourges said to him: “My dear brother, you have
but a moment to live. By that God whom you invoke, in
whom you hope, and who died for you, I conjure you to
glorify the truth.” “I have said it,” answered Calas; “I die
innocent. Jesus Christ, innocence himself, was willing to
die a more cruel death.”</p>

<p>“Unhappy man,” cried one of his judges, “see the faggot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
that shall reduce thy body to ashes; confess the truth.” The
old man gave him no answer; he turned away his head, and
received the final blow.</p>

<p>“The Fathers Bourges and Caldaguès,” writes Count de
Gébelin, in his twenty-third <cite lang="fr">Toulousaine</cite>, “were honourable
persons. These two monks have conferred the highest
praises upon his memory. Although Calas died a Protestant,
they have fearlessly said—<em>Thus died our martyrs of old</em>.”</p>

<p>The widow and children of Calas demanded the repeal of
this iniquitous sentence. Voltaire supported their cause
with his powerful voice. The most celebrated advocates,
Elie de Beaumont, Mariette, Loyseau de Mauléon, interfered;
and on the 9th of March, 1765, three years exactly, day for
day, after the fatal execution, a decree of the council reversed
the judgment of the Parliament of Toulouse, with the unanimity
of fifty votes. The sentence that restored the family
of Calas, tore its bloody axe from the hands of fanaticism,
and branded its forehead with an ignominy that will never
be effaced.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_XV">XV.</h3>
</div>


<p>The end of this period is the counterpart of the last years
which preceded it. A century before, from 1660 to 1685,
each day witnessed new acts of tyranny, and laid a heavier
yoke upon the neck of the Reformed people. From 1760 to
1787, on the contrary, each day lightened their burden.
Four generations of persecutors and of victims had perished
in the interval.</p>

<p>The sanguinary executions that we have just related,
far from injuring the Reformed churches, turned to their
advantage. Respectable people blushed to resemble, in
the most distant degree, the judges and priests of Toulouse.
They became tolerant as much upon a point of
honour, as through a sentiment of justice. The Prince
de Beauveau, who succeeded the Marshal de Thomond in
the government of Languedoc, was loyal, generous, and also
religious. He had several interviews with the patriarch
of the desert, Paul Rabaut, and granted to the Protestants
all he could under the existing <i lang="fr">régime</i> of the laws
of intolerance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span></p>

<p>Fifteen months after the death of Rochette and Calas, in
June, 1763, a national synod was held in Languedoc. All
the provinces, with the exception of those of the north, were
represented at it. The pastors and elders, emboldened by
public opinion, addressed a new petition to the king, and
held firmer language in speaking to their co-religionists.
“All the members of the synod,” they said, “have renewed
with a holy alacrity, as well in their own name, as in
that of their provinces, the solemn promise to maintain
with all their power ... that union so just and so advantageous,
by persevering in the profession of the same faith,
in the celebration of the same worship, the practice of the
same morality, the exercise of the same discipline, and
in rendering each other the mutual help and services which
show that, like the first Christians, they are only of one heart
and one soul.”</p>

<p>Local or personal vexations annoyed the churches, but
without intimidating them, or disturbing their tranquillity.
In Poitou and elsewhere, the faithful had prepared houses of
prayer, which were demolished by order of the public authorities,
and some soldiers were even billeted upon a few
families. The same was also done in Béarn, which was a
puerile parody of the <i lang="fr">dragonnades</i>.</p>

<p>In the county of Poix, the Protestants had opened schools:
they were suppressed. At Nismes, they carried seats to the
places of service, and went thither in bodies: this was forbidden
them. These unworthy molestations were the last
breath of expiring intolerance.</p>

<p>The last religious meeting, said to have been surprised and
attacked, was one near Orange, in 1767. Eight Protestants
of respectable station allowed themselves to be sensed, and
held responsible for the remainder. The officer who arrested
them was more embarrassed than his captives, and offered
the opportunity of evasion. They answered, however, “No;
it is for the public authorities to liberate us.” They were
released at the expiration of two months.</p>

<p>The pastor Berenger was also condemned to capital punishment
in the same year, 1767, by the Parliament of Grenoble,
as contumacious. He was executed in effigy in the town of
Mens. Lastly, two pastors were arrested in Brie in 1774,
and thrown into prison. One died there at the end of nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
days; the other was set at liberty, but sent to Guienne by a
<i lang="fr">lettre de cachet</i>.</p>

<p>There were Protestant convicts confined at Toulon so late
as 1769; exemplifying the shocking contradiction of people
detained in chains for acts, which the government had ceased
to punish. This was in the end understood, and they were
all liberated. At the same time, too, the old tower of Constance,
at Argues-Mortes, was set open. Some of the women
confined there had reached extreme old age, and had passed
more than half their lives in this confinement.</p>

<p>But the treasury was the most difficult oppressor to overcome.
If there were no longer imprisonments, it was still
compulsory to pay heavy fines, and suffer ruinous extortions.
The religionists were squeezed at one time by the
judiciary bodies, at another by the administrative power, and
paid in a manner double taxes, of which a very small proportion
found its way into the treasury.</p>

<p>Many flocks, unknown until this time, because they hid
themselves in the sanctuary of the domestic roof; began to
show themselves. Lyons and Marseilles had their pastors.
Sancerre, Orleans, Nanteuil en Brie, Asnières, and the Protestants
of Picardy and Artois, endeavoured to reconstitute
their respective churches.</p>

<p>Normandy was more advanced. It possessed two or three
pastors, Louis Campredon, Jean Godefroy, and a minister of
Dauphiny, Alexandre Ranc, who established himself in the
province for a couple of years. The little town of Bolbec
was the centre of this Protestant population. It would
appear that the abduction of young girls continued there
after the year 1760; for we read in a petition of the inhabitants
of Bolbec, to whom Louis XV. had granted an
exemption from taxes, to help them to rebuild their town,
which had been destroyed by fire: “Sire, to what purpose
shall we build houses, if we are not sure of dwelling in them
with our families?” (1763.)</p>

<p>At Paris, the Reformed attended the service of the Dutch
chapel, a neutral ground, which enabled them to discharge
their duties towards God, without openly contravening the
ordinances.</p>

<p>The Protestants maintained at their common charge one
or two general agents in Paris, whose official character was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
not, indeed, and could not be recognised by the ministers of
state, but their intervention was publicly accepted, and they
proffered their advice in all important affairs. This mission
was confided, in 1763, to Court de Gébelin, son of the pastor
Antoine Court.</p>

<p>He inherited from his father a great devotion for the
cause of the Reformed churches. Upright, laborious, intimately
connected with men of letters, and known for his
philological works, he brought to the service of his co-religionists
an indefatigable activity and numerous social relations.
He was esteemed at court; he was sought after in
the world; and if he died too soon to witness the abolition
of the edicts of Louis XIV., he contributed powerfully to
their abandonment.</p>

<p>Still, the position of the Protestants at the time we have
reached, was singularly anomalous. There was [in it] nothing
definitive, or regular: moral order was enforced by means of
legal disorder. The arbitrary principle appeared at every
turn; long circumlocutions [were used] to avoid the letter of
the laws without directly violating them; the pastors [were]
half-recognised, half-proscribed, being neither public nor
private persons; the civil condition of so large a number
of French people [was] delivered up to uncertain chances;
justice [was] wavering and contradictory; royalty soliloquized
that it must do something, and did nothing; the
subordinate agents of Church and State turned this precarious
and disordered establishment to their profit by
infamous bargains—a position which it is to be hoped, for
the honour of France, will never be witnessed again.</p>

<p>The political and philosophical writers of the eighteenth
century contributed largely to the triumph of toleration;
but, it must be avowed, they were influenced neither by
zeal nor sympathy for the fate of the French Protestants.
Although they were so prompt in raising bold and delicate
questions, they did not attack the cruel ordinances of
Louis XIV., and never seemed to have heard of the lengthened
sorrows of more than a million of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Montesquieu, who has something to say on every subject
in his <cite lang="fr">Lettres Persanes</cite>, does not mention the oppressed
Huguenots. In his <cite>Spirit of the Laws</cite>, he seems to be rather
adverse than favourable to them; for he accuses the Calvinists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
of inclining to republican institutions; and when he would
recommend toleration, he pleads through the lips of a Lisbon
Jewess. He says, in another place: “This is the fundamental
principle of political laws in the matter of religion. When
it is optional in a state to receive a new religion, or not to
receive it, it ought not to be established; but when it is
established, it ought to be tolerated.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>This left the question as regards the Reformed of France,
entirely undecided; for the laws precisely denied that they
had yet been established in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Helvetius, Diderot, and D’Alembert vouchsafed them not
a word of benevolence. Rousseau, the child of the town of
Geneva, displayed much greater desire to attack (Roman)
Catholicism than to defend Protestantism, and his correspondence
shows that when he was invited by some of his
friends to write in favour of the victims of the laws of
Louis XIV., he refused. He thought it enough to sketch in
a few lines the argument of a plea, which he never resumed;
and in his <cite>Social Contract</cite> he supported the principles of a
state religion.</p>

<p>Voltaire did the Protestants a service in the affair of Calas,
and by his treatise on toleration; but further than this, he
never made himself exactly acquainted with the sufferings of
this greatly oppressed people, or showed any care to advocate a
remedy for them. In his book upon the <cite lang="fr">Siècle de Louis XIV.</cite>,
he speaks of Calvinism in a slighting tone, and dwells upon
petty curious details, rather than upon useful matters. In
his <cite lang="fr">Précis du Siècle de Louis XIV.</cite>, he explains at great
length the quarrels with regard to the bull <i lang="la">Unigenitus</i>, the
refusal of the sacraments, and the expulsion of the Jesuits;
but says not a word about the Protestants.</p>

<p>There are many causes that will explain this indifference.
The Huguenots, as we believe we have remarked before, have
borne the penalty, not of the evil they had done, but of that
which had been inflicted upon them. After being violently
cut off from the rest of the French nation, they were treated
as strangers, whose misfortunes deserved no sympathy; and
their isolation enabled their adversaries to assail them, from
generation to generation, with calumnies which have found a
ready credence in the minds of even cultivated men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span></p>

<p>Let this be added, that the writers of the philosophic
school regarded the Calvinistic doctrines with no affection.
They entertained a repugnance for the austere principles
and rigid discipline maintained by the Reformed churches.
(Roman) Catholicism and Protestantism were for them
nothing more than two forms of the same superstitions.
There is a saying of Voltaire that denotes exactly what he
thought thereon. When a Protestant was presented to him,
who had been released from the hulks of Toulon through his
intercession with the Duke de Choiseul, he said to him:
“What would they have done with you? How could they
find it in their conscience to chain and place a man at the
oar, who had committed no crime, but that of praying to
God in bad French!”</p>

<p>It may be conceived that the pastors of the desert were
not very anxious to have recourse to the assistance of the
philosophers; they feared the influence such auxiliaries
might exercise upon their flocks, and perhaps over themselves.
The pastor Pierre Encontre wrote to Paul Rabaut
upon the subject of the treatise on toleration: “As for
myself, who have read it very hastily, I have found in it
much good, but sadly mixed with poison!” And the veteran
defender of the Protestant faith observed in his turn: “Penetrated
with grief at the sight of the ravages made by the
books of the infidels, I can only moderate it by the thought
that so dire a situation cannot endure.” (1769.)</p>

<p>But if the philosophers could consign the condition of the
Protestants to oblivion, they compelled the attention of the
legists, the parliament men and statesmen. The fiction of
the new converts had become untenable. Not a single honest
magistrate persisted in believing, according to the letter of
the law, that there were none but (Roman) Catholics in
France; and the expectation of bringing the children to
(Roman) Catholicism by the constraint exercised upon the
parents, had been too completely deceived for any to appeal
to this course again.</p>

<p>As the century advanced, the baptisms and marriages of
the desert multiplied. Whether the priests were exacting
or not in their proofs, this question, so grave in the first
fifty years of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, had
lost all its importance. The Protestants rejected at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
price the intrusion of the (Roman) Catholic clergy into their
religious duties.</p>

<p>What course then was to be taken? Births, marriages,
burials, were all without rule, and without guarantee, for a
considerable part of the nation, whilst a shocking contradiction
of jurisprudence prevailed in these matters. One Parliament
accepted the pastor’s certificate, and treated the
marriages contracted in the desert as valid; another Parliament
nullified them; and shameless collateral relations disgraced
the tribunals by claiming a succession to possessions,
to which, according to eternal justice, that spoke with a
louder voice than iniquitous ordinances, they had no right.
The confusion was intolerable.</p>

<p>Yet an issue must be found. It is true that the problem
was more difficult than might be thought or even imagined in
our days. Only complete and absolute principles can resolve
questions with trenchant conciseness. Full religious liberty,
and perfect equality of sects, would have cleared away every
difficulty: but no politician before 1789, would have dared
to make the proposition. The efforts of the times, then,
were exhausted in devising middle measures and laborious
compromises, which, without granting to the Protestants
rights common to their fellow-citizens, should restore to
them their civil condition.</p>

<p>The magistracy, the hierarchy of the Romish church, the
superior public administrative authority, and royalty itself
interposed, each distinctly and apart in this matter, until the
promulgation of the Edict of 1787.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BIV_XVI">XVI.</h3>
</div>


<p>The magistrates, as we have elsewhere seen, took a different
view of the measure relating to the new converts, and also
of the nature of the proofs, to which they were submitted.
This misunderstanding increased with the growing struggle
between the judicial and the sacerdotal orders upon other
subjects. When the Parliaments commanded the burning
of the bishops’ mandates, directed their temporalities to be
seized, and decreed the imprisonment of curates, who molested
the (Roman) Catholics by their fanatical exactions, it is clear
that they would be less severe towards the Protestants, who
defended the sacred rights of their domestic hearth.</p>

<p>It has been thought that the disputes between the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
and the clergy had produced a contrary effect, because
the magistrates desired to establish, by the rigour of their
sentences against the Protestants, the sincerity of their (Roman)
Catholic faith, which had been compromised by their
contests with the priests. This view is correct, if confined to
certain limits, and a certain period. The general fact, however,
is different. The magistracy, in their war with the
clergy, were constrained to reflect upon the boundaries of
ecclesiastical power, to define them, to circumscribe them in
a manner constantly more precise, and from that time to fix
them also in regard to dissentient creeds. Tactics sometimes
prevailed over the idea of right; but right ended in
obtaining the mastery.</p>

<p>The procurator-general, Joly de Fleury, addressed a memorial
to the Council in 1752, in which he constituted himself
the organ of the Parliamentary spirit, all the while that
he was subordinating his thoughts to the fiction of the ordinances.
“Let the priest,” said this illustrious magistrate,
“be simply an officer of the civil state for the registration of
baptisms and marriages; let him add no injurious qualifications
to the information furnished to him; let him in respect
of the nuptial benediction be content with a simple exhortation,
without exacting any verbal or written abjuration, or
any act specially applying to the religionists. All Frenchmen
are Catholics according to law; all should be treated as
such, and in the same manner.”</p>

<p>In 1755, another procurator-general, whom we have
already named, Rippert de Monclar, went farther. Shaking
off the legal fiction, he confessed that there still were Protestants
in the realm, and shuddered at the idea that a hundred
and fifty thousand greedy collaterals might claim the
inheritance of these families, whose marriages had been
blessed in the desert. He proposed, as a remedy, the publication
of bans by a tribunal of justice, and the celebration
of marriages before a magistrate, “according to the
practice in Holland,” says he, “with regard to Catholics.”
This was tantamount to asking for a separation of the civil
and the spiritual authority in respect of the Protestants.
Rippert de Monclar could not foresee that, thirty-five years
subsequently, the measure would be applied to all citizens
without distinction of creed.</p>

<p>In 1766, the advocate-general, Servan, maintained before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
the Parliament of Grenoble the rights of a wife, whose husband
sought to desert her and his children, under the pretext
that the marriage of the desert was null and void. “This
cause,” said the eloquent lawyer, “does not strike us much at
the first view. We see only a weeping woman, who interests
us, without doubt; but in her cause are involved a host of
other interests; her cause is that of all the other persons of
her sect.... Every Protestant is aware of the misfortunes,
which this female has suffered for her religion, and
awaits a decision with anxiety that will perhaps influence
his own destiny as well as hers. Scarcely will a decree be
uttered, before it will be re-echoed among the rocks of
Cevennes, and repeated from mouth to mouth, becoming a
canticle of peace or an order of proscription.” The Parliament
of Grenoble only granted damages and interest, the
sole remedy that a deserted woman could claim; but the
principle had made one further step in advance.</p>

<p>In the same year, Gilbert de Voisins, formerly advocate-general,
and a councillor of state, drew up, at the request of
Louis XV., certain memorials upon the means of restoring a
civil condition to the Protestants of France. He proposed,
among other things, to give some of the ministry revocable
safe-conducts, and to authorize them to perform private
services. The baptisms and marriages of the Reformed
would thus have obtained the double sanction of a civil
contract and a religious benediction, without in any way
affecting the uniformity of public worship in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The magistracy after this never quitted the course they
had adopted; and although they continued to devise strange
or impracticable arrangements, in order to reconcile the civil
state of the Protestants with the maintenance of external
religious unity, they advanced year by year in their memorials
for the legal reversal of the [laws against the] oppressed.</p>

<p>What line did the clergy pursue in the face of the progress
of toleration? Some of their members (it is apparent
that throughout the whole course of this history, we have
joyfully adduced whatever was favourable to them), fell in
with public opinion; and we do not speak merely of the
philosophical bishops and abbés, who affected to be tolerant
through <i lang="fr">bon ton</i> or indifference, for the worthy head of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
diocese which counted the greatest number of Reformed,
M. de Becdelièvre, during forty-five years exhibited a praiseworthy
moderation, and merited the eulogy bestowed upon
him by Rabaut Saint Etienne, at his death. The abbé and
doctor of theology Bourlet-Vauxelles, says in his panegyric
of Saint Louis, which he pronounced before the French
Academy in 1762: “The god of peace does not permit us to
massacre those, who do not know Him.” The abbé Audra
used his influence with the Parliament of Toulouse to legitimize
a Protestant marriage. The curate Bastide opened his
own house to the pastor Paul Vincent, whom soldiers were
pursuing. Lastly, the bishop of Langres, M. De la Luzerne,
spoke in favour of the Protestants in the assembly of Notables
in 1787. “I prefer places of worship to open-air preachings,”
said he, “and ministers to preachers.”</p>

<p>We collect all the evidence of toleration that it is possible
to find in the acts of the (Roman) Catholic clergy, and
doubtless many similar facts have escaped our researches.
But we must add that the majority of the sacerdotal body
obstinately resisted the generous views of the court, the
Parliaments, and the country.</p>

<p>The clergy administered to Louis XVI., at his coronation,
the ancient oath for the extermination of the heretics denounced
by the Church, and M. Loménie de Brienne, archbishop
of Toulouse, said to the monarch, “Sire, you will
reprobate the counsels of a hollow peace, and the systems of
a criminal toleration. We conjure you, sire, do not delay
to dispel the hope, which error has conceived of having places
of worship and altars among us.... It is reserved for
you to strike the final blow against Calvinism in your
dominions. Command the dissipation of the schismatic
assemblies of the Protestants; exclude sectarians without
distinction from all offices of the public administration, and
you will insure among your subjects the unity of the true
Christian religion.”</p>

<p>In 1780, the General Assembly of the clergy presented a
long memorial to the king upon <em>the enterprises of the Protestants</em>.
They complained that heresy lacerated the bosom of
the Church, <em>that tender and afflicted mother</em>; and demanded
that recourse should be had to the <em>salutary means and repressive
measures of the good days of Louis XIV.</em> “Formerly,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
said the priests, “the religionists were rigorously excluded from
offices, public employments, and municipal places; now infractions
of all kinds increase. Formerly they held no religious
meetings; now the holding of assemblies is notorious.
Formerly they were not allowed to dogmatize in public;
now every day witnesses some fresh irreverence against our
ceremonies and our mysteries.... We have felt it to be
our duty to deposit these alarms in the paternal and religious
breast of your majesty. The source of the evil can never be
seriously attacked, unless the foreign preachers be for ever
banished, and unless measures be taken to prevent the
natives from assuming for the future these functions of pretended
pastors.”</p>

<p>Thus they required the exclusion of the Protestants from
all public charges, the banishment of the pastors, the dispersion
of the assemblies; that is to say, the execution of the
most odious ordinances of Louis XIV.; and after having
preferred these requests, the prelates added: “The erring
will ever be our fellow-citizens, our brothers, and even our
children in the order of religion. Ever shall we love and
cherish them. Far from us be the thought of the axe and
the sword!”</p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend how the conclusion of this
memorial agreed with the premises, since it was absolutely impossible—impossible
as proved by the experience of more than
a century—to prevent fifteen hundred thousand of the French
people from exercising their worship, unless they were all to be
drowned in their own blood. But we will not let a word of
bitterness escape us here. We will, on the contrary, express
our commiseration and our sympathy for these bishops and
these priests. Alas! how many of them were destined to
perish in the storms of the Revolution. Their misfortunes
excite our pity!</p>

<p>An ex-Jesuit, Father Lenfant, in 1787 published “<cite>A Discourse
for the perusal of the Council upon the project of granting
a civil condition to the Protestants</cite>.” His language was
much less guarded than that of the episcopacy, and before
reading this tract, we could never have imagined that even
the blindest of fanatics could have heaped up in a few pages
so many infamous libels. The Reformed became, under the
pen of this ex-Jesuit, impious wretches, rebels, monsters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
enemies of all laws, human and divine. We may deplore
also the lot of this miserable madman; he was murdered in
the prison of the Abbaye, on the 3rd of September, 1792,
and it was not a Protestant hand that wielded the homicidal
axe.</p>

<p>This opposition of the clergy did not arrest [the purposes
of] the magistracy; nor was it a barrier for the statesman,
who, less influenced by legal traditions than the members of
the Parliaments, and more struck with the damage, which
the ordinances of Louis XIV. had inflicted upon public
interest, therefore went still further than the others in their
propositions in favour of the Reformed.</p>

<p>From the year 1754, Turgot, who in many points was
in advance of the times in which he lived, demanded the
separation of the spiritual and civil powers for all creeds.
He put these words into the king’s mouth: “Although you
be in error, I will not the less treat you as my children.
Show yourselves obedient to the laws, continue to be useful
to the state, and you shall receive from me the same protection
as my other subjects. My mission is to render you
all happy.” Then, asking himself the question whether the
assemblies of the dissenting creeds would not be dangerous,
he answered it by saying: Yes, so long as they are interdicted;
not, when they shall be authorized.</p>

<p>The Baron de Breteuil, a minister of the king’s household,
gave instructions to Rulhières to draw up “<cite>The Historical
Evidences concerning the cause of the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes</cite>,” which have helped us so often in our researches;
and in 1786 he presented, under his own name,
a memorial to Louis XVI., upon the necessity of restoring
their civil condition to the Protestants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, royalty was loth to take a definitive step.
Louis XV., indifferent to everything that did not concern
his debasing pleasures, had constantly adjourned the serious
examination of this subject. Louis XVI. was animated with
generous intentions, but his intellect was narrow, his conscience
easily alarmed by petty scruples of devotion, his will
feeble, and he was greatly governed by a childish superstitious
fear at the bare idea of touching the laws of his predecessors.
Louis XIV. had contemptuously cast aside “<em>the
perpetual and irrevocable</em>” edict of Henry IV., and Louis XVI.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
trembled to correct in the slightest degree that monstrous
iniquity of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Rulhières and the Baron de Breteuil were compelled to
invent subtle distinctions to prove that Louis XIV. did not
intend to deprive the Protestants of their civil rights; and
that they might better quiet the conscience of the new king,
they represented toleration as the best means of converting
the heretics. They said, “We do not abandon the hope of reuniting
the French Calvinists to the Church; we would rather
aim at it by a more secure way; we would return to the true
course, which has been too long neglected and disregarded.”</p>

<p>While Louis XVI. hesitated, public opinion assumed a
higher tone. The close relations of France with North
America contributed to spread ideas of civil and religious
liberty. General Lafayette, on his return from the War of
Independence, went to Nismes and visited Paul Rabaut,
embraced the old man cordially, and invited his son Rabaut
Saint Etienne to follow him to Paris and plead the cause of
his brethren.</p>

<p>The upright Malesherbes gave the Reformed the assistance
of his knowledge and his virtue. He composed, in
1785 and 1786, two memoirs upon the marriage of Protestants,
and annexed to them a <i lang="fr">projet de loi</i> upon the subject.
“It is but right,” said he, “that I should do the Protestants
some good service, since my father did them so much
injury!” Lamoignon de Malesherbes was a descendant of
the ferocious Lamoignon de Bâville.</p>

<p>All these feelings broke out in the assembly of the Notables
held in 1787. In the records of the proceedings of that
meeting, we read, “The Marquis de la Fayette proposed to
petition his majesty to grant the same civil condition to the
Protestants as to the (Roman) Catholics, and to order the
reformation of the criminal laws. He asked permission to
read a proposition on this subject. This having been read,
the Count d’Artois observed that the object being wholly
foreign to those which had been submitted to the assembly,
it would be going beyond the powers of the Notables to
take cognizance of it; that he would, however, willingly
undertake to mention it to the king, if the meeting desired
it. Consequently, he asked for the opinions of the members,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
and they were unanimous for adopting the motion of the
Marquis de la Fayette.” A suitable address was drawn up,
appealing to the king’s goodness on behalf of “this numerous
portion of his subjects, who groaned under a <i lang="fr">régime</i> of proscription
that was alike injurious to the general interests of
religion, to morality, to the whole population of the country,
to the national industry, and to every principle of politics and
morals.”</p>

<p>The Edict of Toleration was signed, at length, in the
month of November, 1787, a hundred and two years after
the Revocation, not in the form that would have been
required by the principle of well-understood religious freedom,
but restricted within the limits of the opinions of
Louis XVI. and his most influential advisers. The name of
Protestant does not occur in it; the law only spoke of non-Catholics.
The preamble even announced that the king
“would always countenance and favour with all his power,
the means of instruction and persuasion, which should tend
to bind all his subjects by a common profession of the ancient
faith of the kingdom.” The 1st article states that
“The Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion <em>alone</em> shall
continue to enjoy the right of public worship in our realm.”</p>

<p>The new edict granted these four things only to the non-Catholics.
The right of living in France, and of exercising
a profession or a trade in the kingdom, without being disturbed
on account of religion; the permission to marry
legally before the officers of justice; the authority to record
the births of their children before the local judge; and a
regulation for the interment of those, who could not be
buried according to the Roman Catholic ritual.</p>

<p>But these concessions, which were strict and narrow enough
according to the letter of the law, necessarily involved much
more in the practice. The legal existence of the Protestants
was recognised. How could they be prohibited thenceforth
from having pastors, at least to bless their marriages, to baptize
their children, and to console the faithful on their death-bed?
How could they he forbidden to assemble for the service
of their worship, since they had done this under the
severest tyranny? Finally, who was to distinguish between
the private worship authorized by the edict, and the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
worship, which it still persisted in interdicting? Moreover,
there was no penal sanction whatever against the
delinquents.</p>

<p>If this incomplete law gave but little, it allowed of everything
being taken. The Protestants were not deceived in
this. “The Edict of 1787,” says the younger Rabaut,
“spread joy and consolation throughout the families of
the Reformed, and their religious assemblies resounded with
thanksgivings to God, and blessings on the king and his
ministers. The execution of this beneficent edict followed
close upon its promulgation, and the Reformed were soon
seen hastening in crowds to the royal judges for the registration
of their marriages and the births of their children....
Old men might be seen registering, together with their own
marriages, those of their children and their grandchildren.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The edict raised some difficulties in the Parliament of
Paris. The impetuous D’Espremenil was one of its opponents.
M. de Lacretelle says that he had been initiated into the
sect of the <em>Martinists</em> or <em>Illuminati</em>, and that he imagined he
heard the voice of the Virgin Mary, who commanded him
to speak against the Protestants. In fact, D’Espremenil exclaimed,
as he displayed to his colleagues an image of Christ,
“Will you crucify the Saviour again?” This oratorical incident
was out of season, and after addressing some representations
to Louis XVI., the Parliament registered the Edict of
Toleration.</p>

<p>All the churches laboured from this moment to reconstitute
themselves upon the bases of the ancient discipline:
and we may convince ourselves that Protestantism had preserved
a strong hold in the north as well as in the south, and
that the blasts of the storm, however they might have bent
it to the earth, had neither broken, nor uprooted it.</p>

<p>The last consideration that forces itself upon us, is not the
least important. The Reformed people of France had suffered
more and longer than any others in the world. From
1660 to 1787 they had been deprived of all favours, excluded
from all employments, fettered in every liberal career, expelled
from the corporations of arts and trades, and violently
driven back in agriculture and commerce. At the Revocation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
France lost its most illustrious men, the most opulent,
the most industrious, and the most energetic and active [of
its people]; the rest, overburdened with garrisoned soldiers,
crushed with taxes and fines, chased to the woods and mountains,
without schools, without legitimate family, without
assured or certain inheritance, without civil rights, had been
treated like a race of Pariahs; and yet, wonderful to behold!
astonishing to relate! it was found in 1787 that the Reformed
people of France had lost nothing either in intellectual and
moral vigour, or in industrial power. Far from sinking into
degradation, like the Irish under a <i lang="fr">régime</i> incomparably less
oppressive, it had not only maintained itself on a level with
the Roman Catholic population, but had, in the main, attained
a loftier step in the social scale, and possessed a more extensive
and a higher degree of intelligence and instruction.
This fact, which is beyond all serious doubt, offers one of the
grandest spectacles in the history of mankind.</p>

</div>


<p>This division of our history will be shorter than its predecessors.
The period it embraces is not extensive; and it
comprises no memorable events, or great successes and
calamities; and it is more remarkable for ideas than for
facts. But the recital of facts, not the discussion of ideas, is
the object of our labours, and we will follow this plan to the
end with the greater fidelity, in that we are nearer to the
present generation. We have no desire to exchange the pen
of the historian for that of the polemic.</p>

<p>This will explain the brevity of certain details, and even
the absence of certain subjects, which perhaps excited, in
their day, the most considerable interest. We omit them
neither out of forgetfulness nor indifference, but from respect
for our duty. It would be inconvenient in many ways, to
eulogize or blame men still living, or to take part in questions
yet under debate. This is a task that will be better
accomplished hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>We step into a new world from the moment that we enter
upon the history of the Revolution of 1789. Before that
period, every petty reform had to be won by long negotiations,
arrangements, and agreements of various kinds. The
Edict of 1787, although it granted less than had been given
by Henry IV. in the Edict of Nantes, cost twenty years of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
efforts. Now, on the contrary, we shall behold everything
advancing with a firm and rapid step. The timorous scruples
of the monarch, the subtle contrivances of his counsellors,
the blind resistance of the privileged classes, no longer presided
over the public affairs. A great assembly, the faithful
interpreter of general intelligence and conscience, shook off
the shackles of the past which had only sustained itself with
artificial props, and enunciated principles that must resolve
the most important problems of political and social order.</p>

<p>From the 21st of August, 1789, the Constituent Assembly
overthrew the barriers, which had until then debarred the
admission of Protestants to offices of state. Article 11 of
the Declaration of Rights was thus conceived: “All citizens,
being equal in the eye of the law, are equally admissible to
every public dignity, place, and employment, according to
their capacity, and without other distinctions than those of
their virtues and their talents.”</p>

<p>With some slight differences of expression, this article was
subsequently reproduced in each of the French constitutions.
It may have been still disregarded in practice, as it has been,
indeed, frequently, since 1814; but the principle was definitively
won. It triumphed only after ages of persecution,
iniquities, and combats. So tardy are human laws to inscribe
the maxims of truth and justice!</p>

<p>The eighteenth article of the Declaration of Rights was
destined to guarantee liberty of conscience and of worship.
The committee of the National Assembly had drawn it up at
first in these words: “No one shall be molested on account
of his religious opinions, or disturbed in the exercise of his
religion.” This was clear, precise, and unequivocal; but a
curate proposed a restriction, which was adopted. The new
article bore the appearance, in its embarrassed style, of the
impress of the legislator’s hesitation: “<em>No one shall be molested
on account of his opinions, or even for his religious
opinions, provided that he does not, in manifesting them,
disturb the public order established by the law.</em>”</p>

<p>This addition was superfluous in one sense, since it is
evident that every religion must respect legal order in its
acts. In another sense it was dangerous, since it seemed
to confer upon the civil power more authority than it ought
to have possessed in such matters. The priest, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
inspired with this unfortunate thought, ought to have foreseen
that he placed a weapon in the hands of the politicians,
which they would perhaps turn against [the members of]
his own communion. Did the persecutors of 1793 invoke
anything else than the duty of maintaining the order
established by the law?</p>

<p>Rabaut Saint Etienne, who had been nominated a member
of the Constituent Assembly by the seneschalry of Nismes,
perceived the danger, and pointed it out in a speech, which
obtained great applause throughout the country. It is one
of the most admirable specimens of advocacy that has ever
been pronounced in favour of religious liberty: such an
oration has a place in history.</p>

<p>The speaker began by showing that those who have
opposed toleration in every age, have never alleged any
other pretext than that adduced by the imprudent curate.
“The Inquisition always said, in its soft and guarded language,
that assuredly no attack should ever be made upon
thought; that every one is free as to his opinions, provided
he does not manifest them; but that, as this manifestation
<em>might disturb public order</em>, the law ought to watch it with
scrupulous attention; and under the favour of this principle,
the intolerant classes have arrogated to themselves that
power of inspection which has subjected thought, and
enchained it during so many centuries!...</p>

<p>“I discharge a holy mission,” continued the orator; “I
obey the voice of my constituents. I represent a seneschalry
of three hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants, of whom
more than one hundred and twenty thousand are Protestants,
who have intrusted their delegates to solicit from you the
complement of the Edict of November, 1787. Another seneschalry
of Languedoc, and other places of the kingdom, have
expressed the same hope, and ask that you should give the
non-Catholics the liberty of their worship....” (<em>All! All!</em>
shouted a crowd of deputies.)</p>

<p>Rabaut Saint Etienne then appealed to the rights already
sanctioned by the Assembly. “Your principles are that
liberty is common property, and that every citizen has an
equal right to it. Liberty, then, should belong to all Frenchmen
alike, and in the same manner. Every one has a right
to it, or no one has; he who would deprive others of it, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
not worthy of it himself; he who distributes it unevenly,
does not know what it is; he who assails the liberty of
others, no matter in what [fashion it may be], assails his
own, and deserves to lose it in his turn, as being unworthy
of a gift, of which he cannot estimate the value.</p>

<p>“Your principles are that liberty of thought and opinion
is an inalienable and indefeasible right. This liberty, gentlemen,
is the most sacred of all; it is above the control of
men; its refuge is in the depth of the conscience, whither it
retreats as to an inviolable sanctuary, where no mortal has
the light to penetrate; it is the only liberty that mankind
has never submitted to the laws of universal society. To
constrain it is unjust; to attack it is sacrilege.”</p>

<p>Approaching the special question of the Protestants, he
established [the fact] that the Edict of 1787 permitted the
continuance of a shameful inequality between the religious
communions, and that the penal laws against the worship of
the Reformed had never been formally abolished. He
claimed <em>their rights as Frenchmen for two millions of useful
citizens</em>. It was not toleration he asked for, it was liberty.
“Toleration!” he exclaimed; “sufferance! pardon! clemency!
ideas supremely unjust towards the dissenters, so
long as it is true that difference of religion, that difference
of opinion, is not a crime! Toleration! I demand that toleration
should be proscribed in its turn, and it will be,—that
iniquitous word, that deals with us as citizens worthy of
pity, as criminals to whom pardon is granted!...</p>

<p>“I demand for all non-Catholics that which you ask for
yourselves—equality of rights, liberty; the liberty of their
religion, the liberty of their worship, the liberty of celebrating
it in buildings consecrated to that object; the same certainty
of not being disturbed in their religion as you have in
yours; and the perfect assurance of being protected as you,
as much as you are, and in the same manner that you are by
our common laws.”</p>

<p>Some speakers had cited the intolerance of certain Protestant
people in justification of their own. “A generous
and free nation,” answered Rabaut Saint Etienne, “will not
permit that the example of these intolerant countries, who
proscribe its worship among themselves, should be cited
before yourselves. Your high place is to set examples, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
to receive them; and because there are unjust people, are you
to be so too? Europe pants for freedom, waits upon your
teaching, and you are worthy to lead it.”</p>

<p>The speaker conjured up before the bar of the Assembly
the great body of proscribed whom he was defending. “They
would present themselves to you,” said he, “dyed with the
blood of their fathers, and would exhibit to you the mark of
the fetters wherewith they have themselves been bound.
But my country is free, and I would forget with her
both the ills we have shared, and the yet greater evils,
of which we have been the victims. What I ask is, that my
native land should show herself worthy of liberty, by distributing
it equally among all her citizens, without distinction
of rank, of birth, or of religion.”</p>

<p>In concluding, Rabaut Saint Etienne enunciated that every
religion demands a worship in common; that one set of Christians
cannot refuse it to another without contradicting their
own maxims; and that every restriction placed upon the
public exercise of a religion, is an attack upon the basis of
all creeds, since belief inevitably produces worship, which
corresponds to it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the logic and eloquence of Rabaut Saint
Etienne, the Right, succumbing to religious prejudices, the
Centre, governed by political views and pre-occupations, and
the priests of the Left, obeying their doctrinal antipathies,
formed a majority, which accepted the proposed restriction.
Each party had occasion to repent of their resolution.</p>

<p>Four months after this memorable debate, the National
Assembly confirmed, on the 24th of December, 1789, by the
following decree, the admissibility of Frenchmen to all offices
and employments. “1. That the non-Catholics, who should
otherwise have complied with all the conditions prescribed
by the preceding decrees, with regard to electors, and [such as
were] eligible, might be elected to every department of public
administration. 2. That the non-Catholics were capable of
receiving appointments to every civil and military office,
without exception.”</p>

<p>The opportunity of applying this law in the most striking
manner soon presented itself. On the 15th of March, 1790,
Rabaut Saint Etienne, the son of the long-proscribed pastor,
who had been glad to shelter his venerable head under a hut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
of piled stones, was nominated president of the Constituent
Assembly; he filled the chair of the Abbé de Montesquieu.
It was on this occasion that he wrote to his father these
words, that mark so well the change of ideas and situations:
“The president of the National Assembly kneels at your
feet.”</p>

<p>Rabaut Saint Etienne was born <ins class="corr" id="tn-451" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'at Nismes in 1742.'">
at Nismes in 1743.</ins> He completed his theological studies in the seminary of Lausanne.
On his return to France, he was ordained to the
ministry of the Gospel, and fulfilled his functions most
courageously in the emergency when the Parliament of
Toulouse condemned the pastor François Rochette, the three
gentlemen glass-makers, and Calas to death. In the front of
these execrable scaffolds, he unceasingly preached resignation,
obedience to the law, and the duties of fraternal love.</p>

<p>In 1779, he pronounced, as we have elsewhere said, the
funeral oration of M. Becdelièvre, bishop of Nismes. This
discourse having been printed and communicated to Laharpe,
by M. Boissy d’Anglas, that illustrious critic replied: “You
have sent me an admirable composition, replete with true
eloquence, that of the soul and of feeling. It is clear that
everything which flows from the pen of the author, is
inspired by the virtues which he celebrates.”</p>

<p>Rabaut Saint Etienne published other discourses, and a
book entitled: <cite>Amboise Borély, or the Old Cévenole</cite>. In
this last work he painted, under a dramatic form, the sufferings
of the French Protestants at the period of the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, and during the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>Chosen by the seneschalry of Nismes first among the eight
deputies of the Third Estate, his noble character, his oratorical
talents, and his devotion to the public good, immediately
obtained for him great influence in the Constituent Assembly,
over which he was elected to preside on several occasions.</p>

<p>Having been sent to the National Convention by the
department of Aude, Rabaut Saint Etienne brought to his
place in the Assembly a wise moderation, as well as a generous
love of liberty. He sided with the party of the Girondists,
and boldly confronted the popular passions, by refusing to
vote for the death of Louis XVI. “The nation,” he said,
“has sent you to delegate its powers, not to exercise them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
all at once; for it is impossible that it should have desired
only to change its masters. As for myself, I avow it, I am
weary of my part in despotism; I am fatigued and harassed
with it, and loathe the tyranny which I share in exercising;
I sigh for the moment when you shall have created a national
tribunal that will divest me of the features and the aspect
of a tyrant.”</p>

<p>At the sitting of the 3rd of May, he presented the report
of the Commission of Twelve who represented the party of
the Gironde, and maintained an obstinate struggle against
the violence of the Mountain. Its doom awaited so firm a
courage. His arrest was decreed, and his retreat having
been discovered, he was dragged before the Revolutionary
tribunal, who ordered, upon his simple identification, that he
should be executed within twenty-four hours. Rabaut
Saint Etienne perished on the scaffold on the 3rd of December,
1793.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Constituent Assembly. A member
of the Left, the Carthusian Don Gerle, a man of singular,
but unsettled ideas, who had begun to experience some disquietude
about the course he was following with his new
associates, suddenly proposed, on the 12th of April, 1790,
that (Roman) Catholicism should be declared the religion of
the State, and that no other religious worship than the
Romish should be authorized. The Right and a few Jansenists
hailed this unexpected motion with transport. The
bishop of Clermont even asked that it should be voted by
acclamation, as a homage paid to the (Roman) Catholic
religion.</p>

<p>The majority seemed for a moment to be undecided, and the
sitting was adjourned until the following day. In the interval,
the defenders of religious liberty had time to combine. Charles
Lameth had already appealed to the maxims of the Gospel
in favour of the dissenting communions. Public opinion, in
the meanwhile, became agitated; tumultuous crowds gathered
round the building occupied by the legislative body; Mirabeau
recalled to mind the horrible recollections of the Saint
Bartholomew massacre; and Don Gerle, by this time aware
of the dangers of his proposition, withdrew it.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly hastened to give the Protestants
new proof of its good-will. It ordered the restitution of property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
confiscated on account of religion, which was still in
the possession of the State, to the heirs of the lawful proprietors.
By another decree, it restored all the rights of
French citizens to the descendants of the refugees, on the
sole condition that they should return to France and take
the civic oath. Finally, the constitution of 1791 sanctioned
the liberty of religious creeds in these terms: “The Constitution
guarantees to every man the exercise of the religious
worship to which he is attached.”</p>

<p>The legislature had fulfilled its task by proclaiming
true principles; the people had next to fulfil their duty.
But if, in former periods, the manners of the nation were in
advance of the laws, the laws were at this epoch in advance
of popular manners, at least in the southern districts, where
there existed greater ignorance and stronger religious passions
in combination.</p>

<p>The province of Vendée did not rise until 1793, because
it contained scarcely any Protestants within its territory.
In the south, on the contrary, where they were very numerous,
the old antipathies between the two communions began to
explode from the year 1790. These facts were accompanied
by results of grave importance, which require illustration.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_II">II.</h3>
</div>


<p>In the earliest days of the Revolution, the (Roman)
Catholics and the Reformed lived in concord throughout the
south of France, as in other provinces. “Everything worked
easily and naturally by the concurrence of wishes,” says the
historian of the disturbances of Gard, “and the only noise
heard was that of rejoicing, on the receipt of the news of
some favourable event at Paris. In many communes, the
Protestants assisted at the <i lang="la">Te Deum</i> of the (Roman) Catholics,
and the (Roman) Catholics (it is a well-known circumstance),
were also present at the thanksgivings of the
Reformed.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>But differences began to manifest themselves from the day
that the Constituent Assembly decreed, on the proposition
of the Bishop Talleyrand, the sale of the property of the
clergy (2nd of November, 1789). The priests and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
monks persuaded the multitude that it was intended to
destroy the Church, to abolish religion, to persecute the
(Roman) Catholics; and the lower orders of the south, not
being able to vent their anger upon the philosophers and the
Jansenists, of whom they knew nothing, turned all their fury
against the Protestants, who were entirely strangers to the
measures of which they complained.</p>

<p>Violent separations and burning enmities were the result.
The elements of discord were kept alive, increased, and
envenomed by some members of the privileged classes, who
hoped, with the help of religious collisions, to give the signal
for a counter-revolution in the southern provinces, afterwards
to raise the west, then to march upon Paris, and once more
to seize upon their ancient prerogatives. This fact has not
only been avowed, but was publicly boasted of in 1814 and
1815, as an admirable combination to restore the cause of
royalty, the priesthood, and the aristocracy.</p>

<p>Among others, there was a certain François Froment,
afterwards cabinet secretary to Louis XVIII., who published,
in October, 1815, a pamphlet entitled, <cite>An Account of my
Operations for the Defence of Religion and Royalty during
the Course of the Revolution</cite>. He relates therein, with a
frankness that blushes at nothing, all the details of this
conspiracy, of which he was one of the principal agents.
His recital is accompanied by official documents, with which
he substantiates his narrative.</p>

<p>“I went secretly to Turin,” he says, “to solicit the French
princes for their approbation and assistance. At a council
which was held on my arrival, January, 1790, I demonstrated
to them that if they would arm the partisans of the altar
and the throne, and combine the interests of religion with
those of royalty, it would be easy to save both. I was then,
as I am now, convinced of this truth, that a strong passion
must be smothered by one still stronger, and that religious
zeal could alone smother the rage of republicanism.”</p>

<p>François Froment reasoned correctly from his point of
view. The people of the country and the towns would not
willingly have defended privileges, by which they were the
first to suffer. They were instinctively led to cherish a
revolution, which had freed them from tithes and feudal services,
and had bestowed upon them civil equality. But by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
appealing to their religious passions, by re-awakening their
traditional hatred against heretics, they might have been
roused to arm against a cause hostile to their own, and, once
excited, might have been blindly urged further than they
would have desired. This is the secret of all conspirators,
and beneath many a flag recourse will be had to these tactics
so long as ambitious men are found on one part, and ignorant
or fanatical men are met with on the other.</p>

<p>Froment had little difficulty in procuring the adoption of
his project. The emigrant princes (we continue to use his
own narrative), confided to him the charge of forming a
royalist party in the south, and of organizing and commanding
it. Money was given to him, with the promise of
men and ammunition, as soon as the struggle should begin.
He returned to France, travelled through the south, communicated
with the nobles and priests, whose opinions corresponded
with his own, and soon after the two towns of Montauban
and Nismes were deluged in blood.</p>

<p>The conspirators pursued everywhere a pre-arranged and
uniform course. They circulated atrocious calumnies against
the Protestants, and even scattered about the streets and
public squares, incendiary libels without number. The following
extract, by no means the most violent, from one of
these pamphlets, will serve as a specimen of their style:
“Close against the Protestants the door of public offices and
civil and military honours. They seek to participate in the
advantages which you enjoy; but you will no sooner have
associated them with yourselves than their only aim will be
to despoil you; and they will shortly succeed. Ungrateful
vipers, whose benumbed strength, disabled from hurting you,
warmed by your benefactions, only recover to kill you.
They are your born enemies!”</p>

<p>These odious provocations did not fail to produce their
effect upon the masses of the people. The Protestants were
systematically excluded from all the municipal councils; and
generally from all elective offices. This was a first step: the
communal authority might be now wielded to the advantage
of the counter-revolution, and an appearance of legality
thrown over the plans of the faction.</p>

<p>A second line of action was to excite the (Roman) Catholics
to sign addresses demanding unity of religion. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
conferences were held upon this subject, usually at the houses
of the curates, or in the convents. The devotees flocked to
sign, thinking they obeyed the will of God by attacking the
most sacred rights of human conscience, and their fanaticism
increased to a frenzy. The women of the populace, particularly,
enslaved by a servile bigotry, abandoned themselves
to the most savage fury. The Protestants, on their side, were
profoundly irritated, when they saw that their opponents
were bent upon soliciting a new Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes. All this had been foreseen by the conspirators, and
formed a feature of their plan.</p>

<p>But more was wanted: an armed force was necessary.
The regular troops were faithful to the government that had
issued from the Revolution. In the national guard, many
Protestants had obtained high rank, because they generally
possessed more intelligence and ampler fortunes than the
(Roman) Catholics. How were soldiers to be obtained?
Companies of volunteers were organized, who obeyed concealed
leaders. Recruited for the most part from among
the dregs of the people, or agricultural labourers, their
ignorance was a guarantee for their docility, and the
contest might be ventured upon with no mean prospect of
success.</p>

<p>These miserable partisans not only raised the cry of
“<em>Long live the King, and the Cross!</em>” but they shouted also:
“<em>Down with the Nation!</em>” as if they did not belong to a
nation that had just resumed its rights and its liberties.
Many wore, instead of the national cockade, a white cross, in
imitation of the old Leaguers. The brotherhoods of penitents,
who dated so far back as the religious wars of the sixteenth
century, furnished their contingent of devotees. The
League in fine was resuscitated, the League without the
Guises; the League without Philip II. and Sixtus V., the
League after Voltaire—an empty phantom summoned in vain
from its bloody tombs!</p>

<p>On the 10th of May, 1790, the day of the Rogations, which
had been chosen by the municipal council to visit the convents
about to be suppressed, the people rose at Montauban. Six
dragoons, or picked national guards, of whom five were Protestants
and one a (Roman) Catholic, were killed at the Hôtel
de Ville, before they could defend themselves. Many others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
were shamefully maltreated and thrown into prison, where,
however, they found a refuge from the bloodthirstiness of
the assassins. We forbear from relating the details.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June in the same year, the struggle known
under the name of <i lang="fr">bagarre</i> began at Nismes, and lasted four
days. The official report laid before the Constituent Assembly
after a most searching inquiry, shows who were the provokers
and aggressors in this ill-fated collision. The conspiracy is
evident; and it is easy to discover its origin, to follow its
windings, and to convince oneself that religion was only used
as a pretext for bringing about a counter-revolution.</p>

<p>The (Roman) Catholics of the lowest order, whom the
leaders of the faction had armed and collected, committed
the most atrocious acts. We will only cite one instance, that
happened on the 14th.</p>

<p>The youth Peyre, fifteen years of age, was carrying victuals
to his brother, and on his way passed before a company
posted on the bridge of the Isles: a man asked him if he
were a (Roman) Catholic or a Protestant. The lad answered:
“I am a Protestant.” Whereupon the man shot the child
dead. A companion of the assassin exclaimed: “You might
as well have slain a lamb.” “I have promised,” rejoined the
ruffian, “to kill four Protestants as my share, and this
youngster will count as one.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Negotiations were opened; but the reports of some guns
fired from a convent, interrupted them. The (Roman)
Catholics, attached to the cause of the Revolution, joined
the Protestants, and fearful reprisals were exacted. On one
side and the other, a hundred and thirty-four individuals
were deprived of life during these fatal days; for which let
those who prepared, organized, and excited these insurrections
be responsible to posterity! It is gratifying and consoling
to add, that several curates of the neighbourhood of
Nismes, hearkening only to the voice of their consciences,
hastened, at the head of the national guards of their communes,
to aid in restoring order and peace between the two
communions.</p>

<p>In the report read to the Constituent Assembly, M. Alquier
attests in the most formal terms that it was not the Protestants,
who had provoked these conflicts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span></p>

<p>“They became,” said he, “the objects of the hatred of a
party, as soon as a party was formed against the Constitution,
at the period of your first decrees respecting the property of
the clergy; and loaded with the vile outpourings of calumnies,
fabricated against them in order to excite disturbances, and
the outbreak of a counter-revolution, their only enemies have
been the enemies of the Revolution itself.”</p>

<p>At Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Marseilles, where the
Protestants were of too small numbers to afford the opportunity
of throwing more importance into the religious than
into the political question, there was no stir. The attitude
of these places preserved the south from civil war, and the
conspirators were driven to seek the aid from foreign powers,
which their own country refused them.</p>

<p>When quiet was restored at Nismes, the Reformed opened
a place of worship there, according to the right which had
been guaranteed to them by the Constitution. They placed
this inscription upon the front: “An edifice consecrated to
religious worship by a private society: peace and liberty.”
The venerable Paul Rabaut pronounced the inaugurative
prayer, with a faltering voice and tearful countenance.</p>

<p>In the other provinces of France, the Protestants also
applied themselves to their new organization, paying the
pastors from their own purses, as they had long been accustomed
to do, and no longer seeking from the civil power
anything else than the preservation of their liberty under
the safeguard of the common laws.</p>

<p>The Revolution, however, daily exhibited a more hostile
feeling towards the (Roman) Catholic clergy. After having
deprived them of their property, it was determined to impose
upon them a constitution and an oath. This was the work
of the Jansenists, and particularly of the representative
Camus. They were irritated by the remembrance of the
long injuries inflicted upon them by the majority of the
priests, and they were unfortunately powerful enough to
draw into their quarrel the party of the Left in the Constituent
Assembly, which had a presentiment it was about to
commit a serious mistake. The Protestants took no part in
this debate.</p>

<p>The Civil Constitution imposed upon the (Roman) Catholic
church, precipitated the Revolution out of the limits, which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
ought to have respected. A great part of the clergy resisted.
The priests, who were refractory or had not sworn, fled to the
woods and caves, pursued by the insults of that same people,
who had so many times outraged the pastors of the Reformation.
France had not been taught by her spiritual leaders
to bow before the independence of the human conscience,
and the ministers of Rome were now the victims of the
lessons of persecution they had themselves taught. Woe to
them, who take the sword of intolerance; sooner or later it
recoils upon themselves!</p>

<p>These sad conflicts do not belong to our subject. The
(Roman) Catholic clergy, we say freely, did their duty then,
and the politicians failed in theirs. They outstepped the
boundaries of civil authority by pretending to regulate ecclesiastical
points in which doctrine was necessarily implicated;
and having been guilty of this first error, they committed a
second—that of attacking, and of proscribing religion itself,
in order to take revenge for the lawful resistance with which
they had been met.</p>

<p>It is true that no express law was ever passed against
religious liberty. The Constitution of 1793 still contained
an article (22), which professed <em>to guarantee to the whole French
people the free exercise of their worship</em>. But the Convention
by the arbitrary acts of its agents, overthrew the rights
it had inscribed in its legislation, and itself passed decrees
which assailed every religious communion. Thus, on the
22nd September, 1793, it replaced the ancient division of
the week by that of the Decade, and attempted to compel
all the French people to work on the Sabbath, whatever
might be their scruples of faith.</p>

<p>This unjustifiable tyranny was not exercised without opposition,
in spite of the terror which weighed upon France.
The younger Rabaut relates, in his <cite>Ecclesiastical Repertory</cite>,
a circumstance connected with the Protestant communion,
which happened in the commune of La Salle (Gard): “A
country labourer, called Alègre, about sixty years of age,
was arrested and thrown into prison for not having worked
on a Sunday. A week after, this man, dressed in his best
clothes, presented himself before the committee. Being
asked what he wanted, he replied that he was now an old
man, that he had worked the whole week long, that he absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
required rest; that if he went to work on the Sabbath
he would be only robbing his employer, and that he
preferred to be put in prison. The committee, who expected
that he was about to denounce some one, were surprised by
his answer and sent him home.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of November, 1793, Gobel, the constitutional
bishop of Paris, abjured the (Roman) Catholic faith at the
bar of the Convention, accompanied by some priests, who
were well worthy to follow in his rear. He laid down the
insignia of his office upon the table, declaring that there was
no necessity for any other worship than that of liberty,
equality, and morality. Certain members of the Assembly,
(Roman) Catholic and Protestant ecclesiastics, followed his
example. The Bishop Gregory alone had the courage to
ascend the tribune and disavow this apostasy. Rabaut Saint
Etienne was then absent and proscribed.</p>

<p>The abjuration of Gobel was the signal for the invasion of
the churches and the abolition of all religious worship. No
one spoke any longer, according to the language of the period,
but of invoking reason, of listening to the voice of nature, of
lighting the lamp of truth upon the altar, and of rendering
mankind happy by stifling the monster of superstition.</p>

<p>The temples of the Protestants, which had been opened
only the day before, were closed like the churches of the
(Roman) Catholics, and the pastors were compelled to abstain
from their functions under pain of being held as suspected,
and consequently liable to capital punishment. The
delegate of the Convention in Gard and Lozère, published,
on the 16th Prairial, in the year II., a decree commanding
the priests and the pastors to withdraw, within the space of
eight days, to a distance of twenty leagues from the communes
where they had exercised their ministry. The Terrorist
had invented nothing new; he merely copied or reproduced
an ordinance dictated by the Jesuits in the reign
of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Some of the pastors perished by the Revolutionary axe;
others were imprisoned, and among them the veteran of the
desert, Paul Rabaut, who was led to the citadel of Nismes
upon an ass, as his age and infirmities had deprived him of
the strength to travel on foot. “He had seen his eldest son
die upon the scaffold, had wept over the proscription of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
other children (Rabaut-Pomier and Rabaut-Dupuy), and
he was in his turn incarcerated himself. We are witnesses of
the resignation he displayed at this painful moment. Imperturbably
calm with respect to his own fate, he showed
anxiety only for his children and for his fellow-captives, whom
he consoled and supported by his example.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Protestantism counted as many victims in proportion to
(Roman) Catholicism, if not more, either pastors or laymen,
in the days of 1793. The <cite>Dictionary of the Condemned</cite> indicates,
for the department of Gard, where the Reformed did not
constitute half of the whole population, forty-six Protestants,
ninety-one (Roman) Catholics, and one Jew. The members of
the Revolutionary tribunal of Nismes were, with one exception,
all (Roman) Catholics. The French Reformation, to use the
expression of M. Aignan, was never named in the mourning
and terror of France, and it paid the tribute of blood twice
over,—first to the intolerance of Rome, next, to that of impiety.</p>

<p>We find it impossible to trace the Protestant religion at
this epoch. It appears that at Sainte Foy and the neighbourhood,
the public exercise of religion was never completely
interrupted. Doubtless the memory of the aged has
also preserved other instances, but books make no mention
of them. Piety, which had generally been greatly weakened,
nearly everywhere secluded itself in the depth of the conscience,
or in the asylum of the domestic roof.</p>

<p>The day of the 9th Thermidor marked the term of this
oppression, for as soon as public opinion dared to raise its
voice, it demanded and obtained religious freedom. A decree
of the 3rd Ventose, year III. (21st February, 1795), authorized
the free exercise of religious worship, leaving to the
faithful the care of making a provision for it out of their own
subscriptions, and prohibiting them from celebrating any
worship upon the public highways. The constitution of the
year III. confirmed this regulation by the following article:
“No one shall be prevented from exercising the worship he
has chosen, provided he conforms to the laws; no one can be
forced to contribute to the expenses of any creed; the
Republic salaries none.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span></p>

<p>A police law, issued on the 7th Vendémiaire, year III.
(28th September, 1795), commanded that a preliminary declaration
should be made before the opening of places of
worship, and obliged the ministers of the different communions
to sign this formula: “I acknowledge that the universality
of French citizens is supreme, and I promise submission
and obedience to the laws of the Republic.” The condition
of an oath to the following effect was afterwards
added: “I swear hatred to royalty and to anarchy, attachment
and fidelity to the Republic and to the Constitution of
the year III.” The promise of obedience to purely political
laws was just; the order to swear hatred to royalty was not
so, and excited legitimate remonstrances.</p>

<p>Some Reformed churches seized the opportunity, offered by
the appeasement of the public mind and the protection of
the authorities, to re-establish themselves. This restoration
was laborious and slow. There were but few pastors; some
had died during the Revolutionary tempest; others had definitively
abandoned the ministry of the Gospel; and the youths
of the seminary of Lausanne were dispersed. The laity also
displayed little zeal: the scandal of apostasies had produced
a deplorable impression upon them, and many had
given themselves up to the negations of scepticism, or to the
chimeras of theo-philanthropy.</p>

<p>In the midst of this painful re-establishment of Protestantism,
Paul Rabaut gave up his soul to God. He had been
set at liberty after the 9th Thermidor; but the weight of
his years no longer permitted him to participate in the reconstruction
of the sanctuary. He died at the age of seventy-six
years, on the 26th of September, 1795, invoking the
name of the Lord, whom he had confessed before four generations
of Christians.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_III">III.</h3>
</div>


<p>The first consul found the affairs of the (Roman) Catholic
church in great disorder. Sworn and unsworn priests
assailed each other in violent controversies, and divided
their flocks. Buonaparte’s advisers almost unanimously
recommended him to abstain from interfering in the religious
question, assuring him that the advantage he could reap
would be but small, while the difficulties were infinite; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
that it would be better to leave the Church itself to pacify,
as it could, its internal struggles. The new chief of the
state did not adopt this advice, and opened negotiation with
the Holy See. We are assured that he confessed, fifteen
years afterwards, that this was the greatest mistake of his
reign.</p>

<p>A Concordat was signed between the first consul and the
legate of Pius VII., on the 26th Messidor, year IX. (15th
July, 1801). This re-establishment of the alliance between
the temporal and the spiritual powers was necessarily destined
to react upon the position of French Protestantism.</p>

<p>The pope had strongly insisted that the (Roman) Catholic
religion should be proclaimed as the <em>state</em>, or at least as the
<em>dominant religion</em>. Neither the one nor the other of these
pretensions were admitted, lest, as the negotiator of the consular
government stated, the supposition might be excited
of the return of an intolerant and oppressive religion. The
following declaration was merely inserted in the preamble of
the Concordat: “The government of the Republic recognises
the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion, as the religion
of the great majority of the French people.”</p>

<p>This was nothing more than the enunciation of a simple
fact. Nevertheless the council of state conceived that it was
bound to remove any interpretation that might be unfavourable
to the Protestants. We read these remarkable words
in a report submitted to the Consuls in the beginning of 1802:
“While the government has declared that Catholicism is in
the ascendant in France, it has not intended to authorize
any civil or political pre-eminence in its favour. It has
simply signified the priority of the measures it has taken to
secure the independence, which it proposes to guarantee to
all creeds. Protestantism is a Christian communion, which
unites in the same belief and the same rites a very great
number of French citizens. On that ground alone, this
communion is entitled to the protection of the government.
In other respects it deserves marks of consideration and
favour. Its founders were the first to spread liberal maxims
of government in Europe; they gave an impulse to morals,
philosophy, and the useful arts and sciences. In later times, the
Protestants were the first to hasten to the standard of liberty,
and have never deserted it. It is, therefore, the duty of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
government to insure its protection to the peaceable assemblies
of this enlightened and generous minority of citizens,
met together in their temples with the praiseworthy view of
hearkening to the precepts of the religion of Christ....
Everything that is secured to the different Christian communions
by the articles agreed upon between his holiness and
the government of the Republic, is equally guaranteed to the
Protestants, <em>with the exception of pecuniary subvention</em>.”</p>

<p>The Protestant pastors were therefore to receive no
salary from the public treasury, while the bishops and the
priests had one. This was returning to the decree of the
Constituent Assembly, which granted incomes in effect to the
ministers of the (Roman) Catholic creed only, but different
reasons were relied upon. The Constituent Assembly regarded
the salary of the clergy as an indemnification for the
loss of their property. The council of state of 1802, left out
this consideration altogether. It justified its intention of
paying the priests without paying the pastors, upon three
grounds. Firstly, certain expenses might be imposed upon
all for the interest of the majority. Next, the voluntary
offerings raised by the priests for the maintenance of the
(Roman) Catholic worship, begot prodigality and abuses,
which, for different causes, did not exist among the Protestants
in the same degree. Finally, “in the articles agreed
upon between the head of the Roman church and the government
of the Republic, the burden imposed upon the State was
compensated by the right acquired by the government, to
interfere directly and efficaciously in the administration of
the Church by its nomination of the principal ministers and
its control over the subordinate ministers.”</p>

<p>Thus there arose two very distinct positions for the (Roman)
Catholics and the Protestants. For the former, a
state salary, but also the intervention of the government in
the appointment of the bishops and cantonal curates: the
civil power provided the money, and by its money <em>acquired</em>
the right of interference in the affairs of the Church. For
the latter, no salary, but also a full liberty of internal action
[was permitted]. [There was to be] no sacrifice of money on
the one side, no sacrifice of independence on the other.</p>

<p>In reality a decree of nine articles was drawn up, on the
21st Ventose, year X. (12th March, 1802), by which there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
was no question [admitted] but of general measures of police
and common right for the communion of the Protestants.
Buonaparte wrote in the margin of the minute of this decree,
that two articles were wanting,—one respecting the oath of
the Protestant ministers, another respecting the manner of
their appointment; but the project went no farther.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It may be thus seen that the Reformed communion
narrowly escaped completely realizing the separation of
Church and the State. The obstacle came from the first
consul, who, anxious to secure authority over Protestantism
by the oath and the appointment of the pastors, felt at the
same time that he must, in compensation, support the Reformed
faith at the cost of the public treasury; and out of
the desire to possess this influence flowed the law of the
18th Germinal, year X. (7th April, 1802).</p>

<p>If we had proposed to ourselves to write observations upon
the history of French Protestantism instead of relating the
history itself, we might ask what would have been the destiny
of their churches, and what would be their position to-day
if Buonaparte had adopted the advice of his council of
state, and had left them wholly independent without granting
them any endowment. Opposite opinions might be maintained
upon this question with equal good faith; but the
examination of this subject would lead us away from our
subject.</p>

<p>The historical fact, which is the only point that engages
our present attention, is, that the majority of the Protestants,
both pastors and laity, right or wrong, hailed the law of the
18th Germinal as an inestimable favour. They cared less
for the sacrifice of a part of their religious independence
than for the advantages they hoped for from a state endowment;
in which they beheld two great advantages,—a legal
and incontestable recognition, and the official pledge of a
perfect equality with the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Rabaut-Dupuy, who presided in the legislative body in
1802, made himself the organ of the feelings of gratitude
and joy of his co-religionists at the closing of the session.
“Legislators,” he said, “this law of justice has been received
with thankfulness by all Christians; the Protestants have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
recognised all its value.... Restored to the freedom of
civil, political, and religious rights, now that the law organizes
all creeds <em>in a parallel manner</em>, they will be the
firmest supporters of a protecting government.”</p>

<p>He also said, in 1807, in a letter addressed to the Reformed
of the Empire: “You, who have lived like us under the yoke
of intolerance, the relict of so many persecuted generations,
see and compare.—It is no longer in deserts, and at the peril
of your life, that you pay to the Creator the homage which
is due to Him. Our places of worship are restored to us, and
every day new ones spring up. Our pastors are recognised
public functionaries; <em>they are salaried by the government</em>;
the sword of a barbarous law is no longer suspended over
their heads.... Alas! those whom we have outlived,
ascended the mountain of Nebo, whence they beheld the land
of promise; but we alone have gone in to possess it.”</p>

<p>At the same time, however unanimous the Protestants of
that epoch may have been in their sentiments concerning the
law of Germinal, it must be acknowledged that it has in
many essential points changed the constitution of the French
Reformation, and has made it pay dearly for the advantage
of the political equality of the religions.</p>

<p>In bringing the new organic articles before the legislative
body, the councillor of state, Portalis, afterwards minister
of worship, announced that the law had been made upon
verbal or written instructions taken from the Protestants.
“If it appertains,” he said, “to the laws to admit or to reject
different creeds, the different creeds have an existence by
themselves, which they cannot hold of the law, whose origin
is not thought to take its source in human wishes.” One
would thereupon suppose that the government had confined
itself to interrogating the Protestants upon their articles of
faith and discipline, and that it had simply sanctioned them.
But we have only to compare, in order to undeceive ourselves,
the law of the 18th Germinal with the rules established
by the national synods.</p>

<p>According to the ancient order, which is the system of Calvinistic
presbyterianism, religious society exists in and by
itself. It has its supreme authority, its secondary authorities,
its doctrine, its discipline, its means of government, and its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
penalties. In the new order, religious society having no longer
any confession of faith officially recognised; having no power
to establish another without the permission of the civil magistrate;
possessing no longer any general and fixed rules outside
or independent of its relations with the state, and, controlled
in the conduct of its internal affairs by the secular
power, having no government, in the true sense of the word;
it seems to lean for its very existence on a strength that does
not emanate from its own foundation.</p>

<p>Formerly, it was the pastors and the elders who, assembled
in conferences, in provincial synods, and in national synods,
sovereignly decided upon all ecclesiastical questions. They
appointed ministers, tried and adjudged disputes arising
in the flocks, inflicted spiritual penalties, ordered changes
that were thought to be useful; directed, in short, the
churches in their quality of churches, in everything that concerned
piety, morals, edification, and Christian life. Under
the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of 1802, there was nothing that did not seem to
originate with the temporal authority, and everything centres
in it one way or another—the confirmation and removal
of pastors, dogmatic decisions, modifications in discipline, the
projects of ministers of worship or of the consistories, and
disputes among the flocks. Does not this seem to be an
essentially civil organization substituted for an essentially
ecclesiastical organization?</p>

<p>The chief differences, which exist in the general outline,
are also reproduced in the details.</p>

<p>The primitive element, which corresponded to that of the
commune in the political society, that is to say, the individual
church, having its consistory and its pastor, is suppressed, at
least in its proper and distinct authority, by the articles of
1802, and replaced by the creation of the consistorial church,
which is composed of a certain number of agglomerated
Protestants. The five or six particular churches of which it
consists, are nothing more than sections or fragments of the
body, and their consistories have no legal title. It is absolutely
as if all the communes in the domain of the state
were suppressed with their municipal councils, and absorbed
in the purely conventional existence of the cantons.</p>

<p>The law of the year X. concentrates the consistorial capacity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
in the ranks of the persons paying the largest amount of
direct taxes. Twenty-five of these tax-payers nominate the
first consistory. Then the consistory itself designates the
notables, who are, in concert with itself, to provide for the
re-elections to the vacancies. The two conditions of piety
and of fortune may doubtless be found in union; but when
they are not so, it is wealth that will prevail, if the legal
text be strictly complied with. The mass of the faithful, or
the people, according to the expression of the ancient discipline,
have no right of election, of veto, nor of consent.</p>

<p>In the place of the provincial synods, which reckoned from
thirty to forty members, and occasionally more, since each
particular church of the province deputed a pastor and an
elder to them, the law of Germinal instituted district synods,
formed of five consistorial churches. The assembly, therefore,
can consist of ten members only, and may last only six
days. It has no privilege of meeting but with the permission
of the government, after having informed it of the
matters for discussion, and in presence of a prefect or sub-prefect.
Even farther, all the decisions which emanate from
these synods, of whatever description they may be, must be
submitted for the approbation of the civil power. And yet,
for nearly half a century, there has been, in spite of these
excessive precautions, only one district synod, that of Drôme,
which was convoked in 1850.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is no longer a national synod; for the organic
articles having stated nothing about the composition and the
attributes of this assembly, and not having even pronounced
the name, while they carefully determined everything concerning
the district synods, it is beyond all doubt that the
silence of the legislature is equivalent to an entire suppression.</p>

<p>The law of Germinal, therefore, is not the confirmation of
the ancient discipline of the Reformed, as might be inferred
from the speech of M. Portalis; it is, in some respects, its
destruction. It is true, that the change of ideas and manners
must necessarily induce modifications in ecclesiastical regulations,
and that no intelligent man could have desired a complete
restoration of the past. It is also true, that the internal
defects of Protestantism have done more harm to liberty
than the organic articles, and that faith might have corrected
in many respects the vices of the law. Let us not impute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
to the legislator what must chiefly be laid to the charge of
the Protestants themselves. Nevertheless, the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of 1802,
established after the recent excesses of liberty, bears the
marks of an extreme reaction. No subsequent government
would have exacted so many sacrifices of independence, and
the unanimous opinion of French Protestantism, in the present
day, is, that the revision of the articles of the year X. is
imperatively required. Some members of that communion
demand more, others less; but all desire a law that shall
more fully guarantee the freedom of the churches.</p>

<p>It was not so, as we have seen, in the time of the Consulate.
A memorial was simply presented to the political
authority, soliciting the formation of a <em>central commission</em>,
which would have been composed of a pastor and an elder
from each district synod. This commission, subjected to all
the rules imposed upon the inferior synods, would have
endeavoured to establish some unity in dogma, worship, and
discipline, under the eye of the government commissioner.
But the memorial produced no effect.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven consistorial presidents were summoned to
the coronation of Napoleon. In a preliminary conference,
they discussed whether they ought to assist at the religious
service, and after some hesitation, they decided in the affirmative,
either because the emperor was pledged to take the
oath to protect the liberty of worship, or because they feared
that their absence might be injurious to the interests of the
Reformed churches. “It would be absurd to suppose,” they
said, in a deliberation recorded upon the registers of the consistory
of Paris, “that any pastor-president could be compromised,
or have any scruple of conscience respecting a
mute assistance at ceremonies,—religious it is true in their
nature, but which require no consent, no outward sign of
adoration on the part of the spectators,—ceremonies which
are so intimately associated with the civil ceremonies, that
they almost lose the peculiar character imparted to them by
the Roman Catholic creed.”</p>

<p>M. Martin, the president of the consistory of Geneva,
which was then a French town, presented his homage to the
emperor in the name of his colleagues and of all the Protestants.
The answer of Napoleon deserves to be remembered
in history: “It is with pleasure that I see the pastors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
the Reformed churches of France here assembled. I gladly
avail myself of this opportunity to express how much I have
always been satisfied with everything that has been told me
of the fidelity and good conduct of the pastors and citizens
of the different Protestant communions. I am desirous it
should be known that my intention and my firm will are
to maintain freedom of worship. The empire of the law
ends where the indefinite empire of the conscience begins;
and neither the law nor the sovereign can prevail against
this freedom. Such are my principles and those of the
nation, and if any member of my family, whose lot it may
be to succeed me, should forget the oath I have sworn, and,
deceived by the inspiration of a false conscience, should violate
it, I devote him to public animadversion, and I authorize
you to style him a Nero.”</p>

<p>The emperor kept his promise faithfully. There was no
persecution against the Protestants during his reign; [they
suffered] no violence of any kind against their civil or religious
rights; [they enjoyed] a full and continued security.
But it was an internal liberty confined within the walls of
the places of worship. There was a strict prohibition against
any disturbance, or any movement in religious matters.
Neither journals nor associations, neither controversy nor
proselytism were permitted; and if by any act or thought
it was ventured to pass beyond the precincts wherein they
were restrained, the iron hand of Napoleon immediately
drove them back.</p>

<p>We have heard it said that a (Roman) Catholic village
having formed the design of entering the Reformed communion,
a pastor, conceiving that he had the right of doing so,
visited it for the purpose; but he immediately found himself
confronted by the imperial government, which ordered
him to return home and remain quiet. The pastor was
compelled to submit and obey. How many circumstances
[there were] like this are unknown!</p>

<p>If Napoleon forbade the religious sects to step beyond
their places of worship, he reserved the privilege of entering
and commanding there himself whenever he thought expedient.
For instance, on the 19th of February, 1806, he
instituted two <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> upon the simple report of the council of
state; one for the anniversary of his birth, the other for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
that of his coronation and the battle of Austerlitz. The
decree ran, “A discourse shall be preached in the churches
and in the places of worship, by a minister of religion, upon
the glory of the French armies, and upon the extent of the
duty imposed on every citizen to consecrate his life to his
sovereign and the country.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, French Protestantism has, properly speaking,
no history during the fourteen years of the Consulate and
the Empire. Weak in numbers, scattered, without bond or
union, without a common discipline, constrained to be humble
and silent, and to avoid all occasion of disturbing the
official classification of religions, the community of the Protestants
dragged on a uniform and obscure existence.
“The ministers preached,” says M. Samuel Vincent, “and
the people listened; the consistories met, and worship preserved
its forms. Beyond this, no one troubled himself, no
one thought, and religion was a thing beyond the life of all.
This lasted a long while.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>We are not aware of the publication of a single important
book upon dogma, ecclesiastical history, or sacred eloquence,
in the course of Napoleon’s reign. A few occasional sermons,
some courses of religious instruction, some abridgments of
sacred history, three or four translations of English and
German works, constitute the Protestant literature of this
epoch. We do not comprise such works as the <cite>Essay</cite> of
Charles Villers, in which literature, arts, and philosophy
engaged the attention more than religion.</p>

<p>If we confine ourselves to the actual limits of France,
there were not more than two hundred pastors in 1807;
the number is more than double now. The flocks of many
were spread over so wide a breadth of country, that the
pastors were necessarily compelled to lead a kind of nomade
life, which, in itself, would be a sufficient reason for not
judging them severely. Nor can we, indeed, form an idea
of all the good they did in their humble labours, of all the
unfortunates they consoled, the poor they succoured, or all
the souls they edified and brought back to God. Their
burthen was heavier than that of the men who succeeded
them, and their task was less thankful. They had to contend
at the same time against the too great extent of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
ecclesiastical districts, and against the lukewarmness of the
people, who cared for nothing but the military triumphs of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Some of these pastors maintained relations with the German
societies of the Moravian Brethren, and gathered round
them the faithful, who were influenced by the same convictions.
“They were in general,” says M. Vincent, “peaceable
and inoffensive people, who dogmatized little, and made religion
to consist of love, particularly of love for Jesus; whilst
they assembled in small numbers, without show or pretension,
with the intention of a very mild and moderate proselytism.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The French seminary of Lausanne had been transported
to Geneva; but as it was inadequate to the wants of the
pastoral body, the emperor created a Faculty of Protestant
theology at Montauban (1808-1810). The chain of associations
was thus renewed for one of the most ancient and
celebrated of the chief towns of the French Reformation.
Montauban had lost its theological academy in 1661 by the
intrigues of the Jesuits; Napoleon restored it. Men pass
away, and persecutions expire; but the institutions necessary
to human intelligence and conscience fall only to rise
again.</p>

<p>Projects of reunion between the Christian communions
were proposed about this period. Public authority did not
interfere again as in the time of Richelieu and Louis XIV.;
it did not even appear to attach the slightest importance to
the notion, which simply originated with a few private
individuals.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Besançon, M. Claude Lecoz, who had
been a member of the Legislative Assembly, a constitutional
bishop in 1791, and the author of some very severe pamphlets
against Pope Pius VI. on the subject of the civil constitution
of the clergy, felt it incumbent upon him to evince his
zeal for the (Roman) Catholic faith. In the month of
November, 1804, he addressed a public letter to MM. Marron,
Rabaut-Pomier, and Mastrezat, pastors at Paris, in
which he invited them to profit by the visit of Pius VII. to
France, in order to return to the Romish church. “With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
what eagerness,” said he, “would the pontiff acquiesce in
every means of reconciliation compatible with the rights of
truth! With what joy would he open his arms to children,
whose estrangement distracts his paternal bosom!” The
pastors of Paris replied, that no project of reunion was
practicable with the condition of returning as erring and
repentant sheep to the Church of Rome; and that, moreover,
complete religious unity seemed to them utterly impossible.</p>

<p>M. de Beaufort, a lawyer of some talent, entered the lists
in his turn; taking up the question on political grounds, he
contended that a word from Napoleon would reunite the
different churches. M. Lecoz answered this new antagonist
with some asperity; M. de Beaufort rejoined in vehement
terms, and the project of reconciliation terminated in reciprocal
invectives.</p>

<p>M. Tabaraud, formerly a priest of the congregation of the
Oratory, also published a book with reference to the union
of the Protestant communions. He had defended their civil
lights in 1788, against a diatribe of the bishop of La Rochelle,
upon the edict of Louis XVI.; and as he was an
inflexible adversary of Ultramontane opinions, and an enlightened
Jansenist, he had a stronger title than the generality
of his cloth to be listened to with favour. His
attempts, however, had no greater success than the preceding,
and we have only to admire the learning he displayed
in the historical exposition of his subject. Where can be
the point of junction between the absolute authority in
matters of dogma, which Rome will not renounce, and the
right of examination, which the Reformation cannot be
induced to surrender? The most ingenious combinations
must fail to supply the want of a common ground.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_IV">IV.</h3>
</div>


<p>When the dynasty of the Bourbons returned in 1814, the
Protestants made no effort to form a distinct political party.
As agriculturists, proprietors, members of the liberal and
enlightened classes, they did not regret the military domination
of Napoleon. Those among them, who were merchants
and engaged in industrial pursuits, rejoiced at the prospect
of a peace that opened a wider field to their activity. If they
could not repress some disquietude in seeing a descendant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
the prince who had revoked the Edict of Nantes upon the
throne, their recollections reverted to the king who had
bestowed it, and the memory of Henry IV. reassured them
against that of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>It might have been expected that the Bourbons, who had
to contend with so many adversaries, would not causelessly
have irritated a million and a half of peaceable citizens; and
who could have supposed, moreover, that they would have
attacked Protestantism in France, when Louis XVIII. said
that he owed his crown, next to God, to a Protestant prince,
the regent of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The first acts of the restoration were dictated by a spirit
of impartiality and prudence. The Count d’Artois, afterwards
Charles X., having gone to Nismes in 1814, gave a
very gracious reception to the Reformed, and distributed
several decorations of the Legion of Honour among them.
Policy, perhaps, had as much to do with this as confidence;
but the Protestants, satisfied with the protection promised to
them, might refrain from scrutinizing intentions.</p>

<p>The charter given by Louis XVIII. said, in its 5th article,
“Every one professes his religion with equal liberty, and
obtains the same protection for his form of worship.” It is
true, it added in the 6th article, that the Catholic, Roman,
and Apostolic religion was the religion of the state. Nevertheless,
the equality between creeds having been proclaimed
first and formally, the distinction granted to (Roman)
Catholicism would be, according to the terms of the Constitution,
nothing more than a simple privilege of honour,
without any hurtful or oppressive privilege, and the Protestants
were all disposed to concede the honour of the first
place to the Romish church, provided their rights were as
much respected as those of the (Roman) Catholics.</p>

<p>If the charter, therefore, had been well understood by the
masses of the (Roman) Catholics, duly carried out by people
in power, and sincerely admitted by the members of the
ancient privileged orders, there would have been no Protestant
party, in the political sense of the word, nor collision
of any kind. But the first were wanting in intelligence;
there was no spirit of justice in the next, or love of liberal
institutions in the last.</p>

<p>In the south, particularly, the workmen and the peasants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
who belonged to the Romish church, openly threatened the
Reformed with new persecutions, and were not sufficiently
contradicted and repressed by the local authorities. Sinister
reports were spread abroad. It was rumoured that the
places of worship would be closed, and the public services of
the Reformed interdicted. (Roman) Catholics of the lower
order, when they met Protestants in the streets, shouted out:
<i lang="fr">Vive le roi!</i> (<i>long live the king</i>), as if they were the only
royalists. Those of the highest classes, who called themselves
respectable people, openly insulted the most honourable men
of the Reformed communion.</p>

<p>The emigrants, who had returned with the Bourbons, and
others of the nobility, who, shut up for five-and-twenty years
in their castles, had only learned to curse the Revolution,
were indignant at the liberties granted by Louis XVIII.,
and, ignorant of any direct means to abolish the charter,
they fell into the old plans of the conspirators of 1790. A
religious contest, which should make a second Vendée of the
southern provinces, might bring the fundamental law into
question; and the occult government, so frequently denounced
by the sincerest friends of the Bourbons in the two
legislative chambers, began its secret work. It has been said
that these men were more inveterate royalists than the king
himself. But it was not so: they had interests wholly
different from those of the king, interests of position and
caste, and their aim was to satisfy and secure them at any
price, were it at the expense of the kingly office itself.</p>

<p>Fresh addresses were signed, as in 1790, demanding that
there should be only one religion in France. Handbills were
distributed in many of the churches, with these words:
“The faithful are requested to say five <i lang="la">Paters</i> and five <i lang="la">Aves</i>
every day, for the prosperity of the kingdom and the re-establishment
of the Jesuits.” The anti-Protestant controversy
reappeared in many of the pulpits under the most
bitter and violent forms, denouncing heresy as a public
calamity; and the Reformed, pursued with as many provocations,
were in a manner forced to adopt political opinions
in unison with their religious convictions.</p>

<p>We wish to do justice without delay to those, to whom
justice is due. The fault of the attempt, which we are about
to narrate, is not chargeable to the majority of the (Roman)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
Catholics; on the contrary, they were as indignant against
them, and regretted them as much as the Protestants. Nor
must it be allowed to fall on the majority of the priests.
They were no longer to be seen in the foremost ranks of
persecution, as they had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. The populace, excited by some of the secret
leaders, acted without the priests, and often in spite of the
priests. Many of the Roman ecclesiastics courageously interposed
to shield the victims. We shall have occasion to cite
an admirable instance of this.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of the south when the emperor
disembarked upon the coasts of France. The Protestants
of Nismes offered the Duke d’Angoulême their services as
royal volunteers. The prince was ready to accept them,
when the fanatics repulsed them with this insult: “We will
not endure these rascally Protestants!” Their purses were,
however, taken, if not their persons.</p>

<p>On Napoleon’s re-entry into Paris, the Protestants resumed
the places and the legitimate influence, of which they
had been deprived. They could count upon the protection
of the laws, and testified a satisfaction that may be easily
comprehended. But they were far from committing the
excesses with which they have been reproached. The faction
of 1815 felt it necessary to accuse them with expressly invented
crimes, in order to extenuate their own. All the
massacres of the Hundred Days, which have been ascribed to
them, are confined, as the official documents attest, to the
death of two royal volunteers, who were killed at Arpillargues
(Gard), in a disturbance they had themselves provoked,
by obstinately persisting in marching through the village
with fifty of their companions, sword in hand.</p>

<p>As soon as the defeat of Waterloo was known at Nismes,
the royalist bands were reorganized, and ordered the municipal
council to declare immediately for the government of
Louis XVIII., although no order of any kind had arrived
from Paris. The council replied that it was necessary to
wait for official instructions, and published a proclamation, in
which it said: “Fellow-countrymen of every opinion, for
whom we have equal solicitude, in the name of the efforts
we have made to avert the disasters which threaten our
country, in the name of your dearest interests, in the name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
of God, who enjoins upon you clemency and concord, do not
be deaf to our voice.” (18th July, 1815.)</p>

<p>The following day a courier announced the return of the
king to the capital, and the Reformed population quietly
resumed the white cockade. This prompt submission did
not satisfy the men who had adopted the white and green
colours, attesting by this that they served another cause than
that of royalty. Then terror rose and spread itself over the
south.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, a hideous populace, recruited at
Nismes, Beaucaire, and the surrounding places, attacked the
garrison, which, weakened by the numerous desertions after
the news of the emperor’s fall, did not reckon more than
two hundred men. These brave soldiers, besieged in their
barracks, were aware that any resistance would produce only
a useless effusion of blood, and consented to capitulate.
The next day, at break of dawn, having laid down their
arms in compliance with an express arrangement, they
marched out of their quarters, four abreast, with firm though
sorrowful demeanour. But the miscreants through whom
they had to pass, fired upon them in treacherous violation of
the surrender, and trampled underfoot the corpses of the
murdered veterans.</p>

<p>All regular authority was at an end in Nismes. Pillage,
incendiarism, and assassination, desolated this great city. The
details are horrible. “Of crimes upon crimes,” says M.
Lauze de Peret, with energetic eloquence, “shall I have to
speak; of wretches without fear, of peace without repose,
of entire submission without security, of a city without
guardianship, of victims without defence, and of chiefs mute
without being absent.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The Count René de Bernis, the royal commissioner, and
the Marquis d’Arbaud-Jonques, appointed prefect of the department
after the Marquis Jules de Calvières, who was only
provisional prefect, have published justificatory memoirs.
These have, however, been contradicted upon almost every
point by M. Madier de Montjau, in his petition to the Chamber
of Deputies, and by other respectable citizens. It is right
that persecutors should learn that truth has necessarily its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
day; it is also right that they should remember that history
does not stop to pick from the gore the names of the subordinate
cut-throats, but that it casts the blame and odium
upon those who ought to have withheld and punished them.</p>

<p>This spirit of savage fanaticism soon spread beyond the
precincts of Nismes. The whole surrounding country was
abandoned to the fury of some hundreds of brigands, who,
while they imposed ruinous contributions, devastated property,
sacked houses, maltreated the most inoffensive citizens,
insulted women, profaned the sacredness of the burial-grounds,
and finally massacred those, whose position or some
false rumour marked out for popular vengeance, huzzaed for
the Cross! and the King! committing at the same time
crimes equally opposed to the holiest interests of religion and
royalty.</p>

<p>If the unhappy Protestants assembled anywhere in arms
for their common defence, or for the protection of the asylum
of the aged and the cradle of the young, they were treated
as factious rebels. They were dragged before judges, who
would not, or dared not do them justice; and these contemptible
tribunals raged against the victims, instead of striking
the murderers.</p>

<p>Among other towns, that of Uzès had been invaded by a
band of robbers, on which occasion a priest evinced remarkable
self-devotion. The authorities were either alarmed or
were accomplices, and the national guard remained passive.
“One single man, a worthy minister of the law of charity, a
priest of the God, who has commanded all mankind to live
together as brethren, the abbé Palhien, set a different example.
He encountered Graffan (Quatretaillons) near the church
of Saint Etienne; he prayed, he insisted, he knelt to him:
but he followed him in vain to the fatal place, he pleaded in
vain the words of religion to this bandit armed for the
defence of the altar and the throne. On this memorable day,
Uzès appeared to contain but one single Christian, one single
Frenchman.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Terror lasted for several months. Towards the end
of August, four thousand Austrians arrived in the department
of Gard. They had been made to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
Protestants menaced public tranquillity, and that it was
necessary to defend both law and order against their hatred.
They advanced with great precaution, sword in hand, as if
they had entered an enemy’s country, and were surprised to
find a peaceful population, abandoned to the fury of robbers,
and decimated by assassination.</p>

<p>It may be asked how such disorders could have happened
without exciting universal indignation, at such a period and
in a country like France. The answer is, that the whole
country was at that time delivered up to a violent reaction.
There was no liberty of the press; no right, save that of the
conqueror; the spirit of party oppressed and disorganized
everything. The official journal of Gard, which was published
in the police offices or in those of the prefecture, did
not hesitate to contest the most evident facts, nor to deny the
most authentic,—to boast of the clemency and the generosity
of the enemies of the Protestants, with the corpses of the
victims before their eyes. And if any one, even away from
this unfortunate province, uttered a free thought respecting
these atrocities, he was reputed as a calumniator and a rebel.</p>

<p>M. Voyer-d’Argenson experienced this, when in the session
of the 23rd October, 1815, he demanded an inquiry, affirming
that his heart bled to hear the reports of the massacres
of Protestants in the south. He was violently interrupted
with cries of order, and notwithstanding the forms of speech
which he employed in his explanations were expressive of
doubt, the call to order was agreed to by a large majority.
Did the chamber of 1815 think that by stopping M. Voyer-d’Argenson’s
mouth, it could smother the terrible cry for
blood and the voice of truth?</p>

<p>The government was better instructed than it cared to
make known. Louis XVIII. was an enlightened prince,
who was aware of the true position of affairs, and he was
not a little anxious respecting the impression which the
crimes of the south would produce upon the opinion of
France and of Europe. England and Prussia, the two countries
whose armies had restored his crown on the battle-field
of Waterloo, began to show signs of disquietude; and the
cabinet of London, interrogated in the House of Commons,
appealed to the guarantees of the charter in favour of the
French Protestants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span></p>

<p>The Duke d’Angoulême was sent, in the month of November,
to the southern provinces. He found the places of worship
of Nismes closed,—all public exercise of religion had
been suspended from the middle of July,—that a part of the
Protestant population had been driven from their homes by
the dread of massacres,—that others were hidden in their
houses as if they were a proscribed race, whilst assassins
stalked boldly abroad, the magistrates powerless, and the
laws inoperative.</p>

<p>Some delegates of the consistory, confounded by the crowd
of civil functionaries, in order that they might avoid the ill-treatment
of the populace, went to pay their respects to
the duke, and met with a most favourable reception. He
gave them an order to reopen their places of worship from
the following Thursday, the 9th of November. But none
were opened until Sunday, and then but one. The result
proved that too much reliance had been placed upon the
good disposition of the people and their leaders. Tumultuous
assemblages collected round the religious edifice, shouting:
“Down with the Protestants! Death to the Protestants!
Let us have back our churches! Scourge them back to the
desert!” The doors were broken open, and a band of
wretches burst into the place of meeting. The General
Lagarde, who was endeavouring, with some fellow-officers, to
repress the assailants, was shot through the heart; and perhaps
this disaster prevented the commission of still greater
crime; for the populace, struck with dismay, hastily fled,
thinking only of their own safety.</p>

<p>This assassination of a soldier of high rank, committed
before the whole town, obeying the orders of a prince of the
blood, left the government no longer the opportunity of
denying the excesses of the reaction or of temporizing. On
the 21st of November, Louis XVIII. published an ordinance
with the following preamble: “An atrocious crime has
stained our town of Nismes. Despite the constitutional
charter, which recognises the Catholic religion as the religion
of the State, but which guarantees to other creeds protection
and liberty (the minister thought of this very tardily), seditious
crowds have dared to oppose the opening of a Protestant
place of worship. Our military commandant, whilst striving
to disperse them by persuasion before using force, has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
assassinated, and his murderer has fled from the officers of
justice. If such a crime were to remain unpunished, public
order and government would be at an end, and our ministers
guilty of not executing the laws.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the more than usual solemnity of this
ordinance, which commanded the arrest not only of the
assassin of General Lagarde, but also of the authors, fautors,
and accomplices of the disturbance of the 12th of November,
the judges punished no one. Even the murderer of the
general was acquitted; and the other bandits, who had devastated
half the province with incendiarism and assassination,
were allowed to display an insolent and odious impunity
upon the very scene of their misdeeds. Witnesses were
afraid to come forward to give testimony against them, and
mysterious protectors gained their absolution.</p>

<p>The Protestant worship was at length re-established in
Nismes, after an interruption of six months, on the 17th of
December, 1815. Yet the apprehensions of the Reformed
were not calmed, and security did not fully return until the
issue of the ordinance of the 5th of September, 1816, which
again raised the hopes and the strength of the liberal party.</p>

<p>We will not terminate the narrative of the troubles of
Gard, without paying a just tribute of respect to the pastors
of this province. Some threw themselves before their armed
parishioners, conjuring them in the name of the Gospel, not
to return evil for evil. One particularly, M. Juillerat Chasseur,
now president of the consistory of Paris, who was called
to officiate on the fatal day of the 12th November, continued
his prayers with a serene countenance and unfaltering voice,
in the midst of the shouts of death from an enraged populace,
and compelled the respect of these madmen, who had cast
aside all reverence for the majesty of the sanctuary. He
felt that the least sign of weakness on his part might have
led to a frightful catastrophe. Such courage is both more
grand and rare than that of the soldier on the battle-field.</p>

<p>In the other departments, saving two or three exceptions
of little importance, the Protestants were neither molested
in their worship, nor assailed in their persons or their property.
Public opinion came to the assistance of the law, and
deprived intolerance of its hope of again renewing the persecutions
of the olden times.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span></p>

<h3 id="BV_V">V.</h3>
</div>


<p>After the re-establishment of order, two opposite influences
began to act upon the conduct of political power towards the
Protestants; whence there ensued more or less contradictory
acts, and a singular mixture of good-will and hostility until
the Revolution of 1830.</p>

<p>On one side the promises of the Charter; the desire of not
alienating so many citizens, who reckoned, in proportion to
their number, more electors than the (Roman) Catholics; respect
for opinion, the national conscience, which would have
revolted against every direct measure of persecution; the
fear, in short, of giving new weapons to the opposition, which
was ready to take up the cause of the Protestants as their
own; these reasons were quite sufficient to recommend to
the Bourbons and their ministers the maintenance of a prudent
reserve.</p>

<p>But on the other side, the natural and intimate alliance,
which existed between the ancient dynasty and the old religion;
the necessity of meeting the requirements of the
clergy in order to gain their support in the struggle against
the new spirit; the growing influence of the Jesuits, and
the congregations, particularly under the reign of Charles X.;
the conduct and the demands of the members of the Right,
who laboured incessantly for the restoration of (Roman)
Catholicism for the sake of political interest; perhaps also
some vague distrust of the tendencies of Protestantism, and
some disagreeable recollections of which the descendants of
Louis XIV. have never been able to rid themselves completely;
all this explains the hostility, sometimes hidden,
sometimes avowed, which the Reformed might complain of
after the Restoration.</p>

<p>To look first of all at the favourable side, we will remark
that the numbers of the Protestant faith sensibly and constantly
increased. New pastoral districts were created, new
places of worship built, and more abundant means of elementary
instruction were granted out of the public purse. This
increase was even more rapid under Charles X. than under
Louis XIII.; and the cause of this is easy to be indicated:
whatever was given to the Protestants, facilitated the passing
of the prodigal grants which were lavished upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
(Roman) Catholics, and a few thousand more francs for the
former, covered with a varnish of impartiality the millions
distributed to the latter.</p>

<p>In the annual presentations of public bodies, the two
kings never failed to reassure the Protestants of their protection
and good-will. When he ascended the throne,
Charles X., who felt that he was under a still greater obligation
than his predecessor to give solemn guarantees to
liberty of conscience and of worship, said to the consistory
of Paris: “Assure yourselves, gentlemen, of my protection,
as you did of that of the king, of whom you have been deprived.
All Frenchmen are equal in my eyes; all Frenchmen
have an equal right to my love, my protection, and my
favour.”</p>

<p>A Protestant committee, composed of peers and deputies,
was formed under the ministry of M. Decazes, and was continued
under that of M. de Villèle. Not only did the
government offer it no opposition, but it approved and
seconded this non-official commission. In 1824, M. Georges
Cuvier was placed at the head of the Faculties of Protestant
theology; and four years later, under the ministry of M. de
Martignac, he exercised the functions of director of the non-Catholic
worship. The learning and integrity of this illustrious
man were well fitted to inspire the Protestants with
confidence against the enterprises of the clerical party.</p>

<p>From 1817 to 1830, in a word, we have to complain of no
important act of intolerance; we might relate favours sometimes,
and always security for the mass of the Protestant
population. It is but justice due to the elder branch of the
Bourbons, and we do it with the more willingness, that the
last of the race is an exile from his country.</p>

<p>But the same justice also requires that we should present
the reverse of the picture, always taking care to add, in
order that nothing owing to great misfortunes may be
omitted, that for the words and acts unfavourable to the
Protestants, the imprudent counsellors, who surrounded the
princes, are more responsible than the princes themselves.</p>

<p>A powerful and restless faction was bent on interpreting
after its own fashion, the article of the Charter which constituted
the (Roman) Catholic religion the religion of the
state. It was no longer merely a question of the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
rank of honour, but of a real pre-eminence applied to every
institution, and to every measure of public authority.
According to these strange commentators upon the fundamental
law, the 6th article, which granted an official prerogative
to Roman Catholicism, ought to override the 5th
article, which established equality of protection and liberty
for every creed, whilst according to common sense, logic,
and the very order in which the articles were placed, the
special privilege should be subordinate to the general principle.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The Jesuits and their allies openly declared that to put
all religious communions upon the same footing, was an anti-Catholic,
anti-social, and impious maxim. A ministerial
bishop did not hesitate to declare that the non-Catholic
creeds were only tolerated, and M. de Peyronnet pronounced
these imprudent words in his defence of the law of sacrilege
in the tribune: “I recognise an equality of protection promised
to the creeds sanctioned in the kingdom, and I respect
it; but an equality of creeds, I do not recognise at all.”</p>

<p>The law, of which we speak, confounded the spiritual with
the temporal, and importing the (Roman) Catholic dogma
into the domain of legislation, established a great inequality
between the two creeds. No profanation of Protestant
worship any longer incurred the penalty of imprisonment,
whilst profanation of the (Roman) Catholic worship was
punished with the pain of death, and even, in the project of
the government, with that against parricides. This alone
ought to have told Charles X. and his ministers that they
were pursuing a fatal course. Protestantism lost nothing
by the measure; the cause of the Bourbons and the priests
suffered immensely.</p>

<p>Another consequence, which it was attempted to deduce
from the principle of the state religion, was that non-Catholics
should be compelled to do some act, if not of adoration,
at least of homage and indirect participation in certain ceremonies
of (Roman) Catholicism. Thus it was insisted that
they should hang the fronts of their houses with tapestry on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
the passage of the (Roman) Catholic processions, under
penalty of process and fine. Yet it had already been made
a question whether processions without the precincts of the
churches were not a violation of the organic articles, and
generally whether, in a well-organized society, any creed
whatsoever should have the right of transporting the celebration
of its particular rites into the public streets and
highways. But without insisting upon these two points, it
may be conceived that the Protestants would energetically
refuse to decorate their houses; for they must perceive in
this, a serious attack upon their ancient discipline, a defiance
of the independence of their personal faith, and an attempt
against the equality of creeds, and against their very liberty
itself.</p>

<p>In order to try the point, the Jesuits had put forward
some functionaries of subordinate degree, such as the Count
de Narbonne-Lara, sub-prefect of Florac, who suddenly and
upon his own authority, published a circular ordering the
inhabitants, of whatsoever religion [they might be], to decorate
the front of their houses against the passing of the Holy
Sacrament. The consistory of Barre answered this sub-prefect,
on the 19th of May, 1818, with a categorical refusal,
appealing at the same time to the discipline of the Protestants
and to the Charter.</p>

<p>Similar attempts were made in other places, and several
citizens were fined for not having obeyed this iniquitous
assumption. But there was one M. Paul Roman, of Lourmarin,
who would not submit to the sentence of the inferior
tribunals. He appealed to the supreme court, and won his
cause after a prolonged hearing. M. Odillon Barrot supported
him with his eloquence, and proved that religious
liberty was altogether involved in the question. “This
cause,” he said, “is not that of a Protestant; it is not even
that of the Protestants solely; it is that of every citizen,
whatever may be his religion, whatever may be his religious
opinions, apparent or not apparent; the whole body of
citizens are represented by M. Roman in this matter.”</p>

<p>The Court of Cassation passed a decree on the 20th November,
1818, conformable to justice, law, and the rights of minorities.
An affair of the same kind was also tried at Marseilles
in 1820, and decided in like manner to that we have mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span>
in favour of the Protestant appellant. The government
itself renounced this illegal exaction, in spite of the
clamours of the fanatics, and the point was definitively settled.</p>

<p>Another pretence was set up, more dangerous in its principles,
more serious in its effects, more obstinate in every
respect, and from which even the politicians of the present
day have not yet completely freed themselves. This consisted
in restricting the Protestants to certain boundaries,
as if Protestantism was such an evil that it was necessary
to confine it within the narrowest possible limits. It appeared
as if the disciples of the Reformation were told,
“Since you exist in the kingdom, we tolerate you; but
remain where you are, and guard yourselves from trespassing.
Unity of faith is our rule, dissent the exception; and far
from authorizing it to spread, we will restrict it to the fullest
extent of our power.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be more opposed [than this] to the Charter,
which assured equal liberty to all creeds. For as the Romish
clergy had always and everywhere the right of proselytizing
in the bosom of Protestantism, it is evident that if the
pastors were refused the privilege of making proselytes in
their turn among the (Roman) Catholics, equal liberty was
nothing but a bitter mockery.</p>

<p>The Charter would not be respected, at least in one sense,
unless the priests were interdicted from converting Protestants,
as well as the pastors from converting (Roman)
Catholics. Now this was a condition, which the Roman
clergy would never accept; it could not; it ought not [accept
it]; it would have been a disgraceful prevarication on their
part, and they would have been right in not subjecting themselves
to it, even in Protestant countries. But then there is
no logical or legitimate resting-place, but the common right,
or liberty of proselytism for all.</p>

<p>The government of the Restoration did not always do its
duty in this matter. It invented administrative fetters,
judiciary obstacles, and obstinately relied upon the 21st
article of the penal code, according to which no association
of more than twenty persons, could be formed without the
concurrence of the authorities. By applying this article to
religious assemblies, it was clear that the establishment of
every new assembly, the opening of any new place of worship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
depended upon the pleasure of the civil authority. Liberty
of religion ceased to exist for the French Protestants beyond,
or without those places of worship which were counted and
numbered by the State. This was almost returning to the
vicious maxims of the first years of the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Incessant contests, as might have been expected, were the
result of such an application of the law. We will cite only
two circumstances, in which the two greatest towns of France
were concerned. In 1825, the consistory of Paris, although
it demanded the free exercise of religion, not for converted
(Roman) Catholics, but for Protestants by birth, was hindered
from opening a place of worship in the commune of Ageux,
“because,” ran the administrative decree, “the establishment
of feeble fractions of a dissenting population in the midst of
a population of an homogeneous creed, would not be without
inconvenience!” This was the very language of the persecutors
of the sixteenth century. In 1826, some communes of
the neighbourhood of Lyons expressed a desire to hear the
doctrines of the Reformation preached; the authorities interposed
in spite of the reclamations of the consistory. But in
these two cases the hands of government were strengthened
both by this version of the law, and public opinion.</p>

<p>While the attempt was made to imprison Protestantism
within its official walls, all the doors were thrown wide open
to the proselytism of the (Roman) Catholic clergy. Three
pastors having embraced the Romish faith under the Restoration,
their pamphlets against the communion they had
abandoned obtained the honour of being printed at the
royal press, and they were even rewarded with a pension.</p>

<p>The idea was also conceived of resuming the ambulating
missions of the seventeenth century, with a double task,
instead of one; for they were charged with the conversion
of the followers of Voltaire, as well as those of Calvin.
These vulgar declaimers travelled with their crosses from
town to town, and village to village, vociferating in the public
places senseless invectives against the Reformation and
philosophy. Far from winning either Protestants or unbelievers,
they only disgusted the more healthy and enlightened
portion of the (Roman) Catholics. Many respectable priests
were themselves ashamed of such discreditable auxiliaries,
feeling that the power of (Roman) Catholicism was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
re-established by scenes, in which the populace were the chief
actors.</p>

<p>The defenders of the two communions maintained controversies
in a higher region, which did not at least do violence
to the laws of public decency. Some men of eminent reputation,
although but mediocre theologians,—M. de Bonald,
M. Joseph de Maistre, and M. <ins class="corr" id="tn-488" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'de Lamenais'">
de Lamennais</ins>, who has since
refuted his own opinions more effectually than any of his
antagonists could have done, assailed the Reformation with extreme
pertinacity, and were much more successful in assailing
it than the justness of their arguments warranted. They
were creditably met, however, by MM. Stapfer, Samuel
Vincent, Henri Pyt, and others, opponents who, less known
to fame, indeed, defended the Protestant creed with more
logic and vigour.</p>

<p>The substance of these polemics did not, generally, bear
much resemblance to the great discussions of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Religion, in those times, was
supported on each side for the sake of religion itself; it was
dogma, and particularly the dogma of the Holy Supper, that
engaged controversialists. Under the Restoration, the most
renowned advocates of (Roman) Catholicism took up another
ground. Religion had become a political weapon. Putting
aside doctrinal matters, the [disputants] exerted themselves
to effect the establishment of the position, that the unity and
authority of the Roman (Catholic) Church secure the power
of princes, obedience to the laws, and the maintenance of
social order better than Protestantism. Heavenly interests
were of secondary importance to those of the earth, or were
not considered at all.</p>

<p>Doubtless it might be possible to meet with some discussions
purely dogmatical or ecclesiastical, at this period; but
they attracted little notice, and awakened no echo amongst
the masses of the country. The tide of humanity seems to
have retreated from its ancient landmarks, to hollow out a
new bed on unknown shores.</p>

<p>There is no other fact deserving mention in the external condition
of French Protestantism, until the Revolution of 1830.
The 3rd article of the Charter, which declared all citizens to
be equally admissible to civil and military offices, might, and
ought to have been observed under certain circumstances. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
professorial chairs of instruction were rarely conferred upon,
and were as lightly taken away from, the Protestants. The
same partiality was shown, although in a less degree, in the
distribution of public appointments; where the merit was
equal, to say no more, the (Roman) Catholic nearly always
prevailed against the Protestant; and this dislike continued
to increase every day, as the ill-fated Charles X. gave himself
up more unreservedly to the counsels of those who
ruined him.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_VI">VI.</h3>
</div>


<p>In treating of the internal condition of Protestantism, we
shall make mention, as we have done when speaking of the
preceding periods, less of opinions considered in themselves,
than of the men who were their most distinguished representatives.</p>

<p>When the peace of 1815 had allayed the storms which
had shaken thrones and nations, the popular mind experienced
a calm approaching to the void. The illusions of glory, the
dreams of distant conquests vanished. There was now leisure
to breathe, to think of oneself, and the want of something,
upon which to fix the mind, was experienced. One class
turned itself to the cultivation of the sciences, literature,
social questions, historical studies, or to industrial works;
another, much less numerous, sought from religious belief
a satisfaction of the wants of their conscience and their
heart.</p>

<p>The freedom once more permitted of making ideas known,
facilitated and gave life to this religious movement: not
that faith is unable to grow beneath outward oppression, for
we may see splendid examples to the contrary in the history
of Protestantism; but the independence of thought and
action is the true atmosphere of spiritual existence.</p>

<p>Finally, the return to religious subjects was strengthened
by the relations that were re-established between the Protestants
of France and those of other countries. The Reformation
had, for half a century, inspired great works, and
founded great associations; it had despatched its missionaries
to the extremities of the globe, and distributed the Bible in
every human tongue by millions of copies. When French
Protestantism was brought into contact with these noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
aspirations of Christian life, it learned to know its duties
better, and to fulfil them with greater fidelity.</p>

<p>Many pious souls resumed the ancient faith of the Reformed
churches, and displayed in acts of religion and proselytism,
an energy, a zeal, and an ardour of which later
generations had lost the tradition. This change was not
always well understood, not only by the masses, but by men
of superior intelligence, and provoked painful dissensions.
The names of Methodist and Rationalist, the one borrowed
from Germany, the other from England, became party cries.</p>

<p>These divisions just began to appear when Protestant
France lost a man, who, having inherited the doctrines
taught in the churches of the desert, yet having abstained
from the new conflicts, might have given a lofty and powerful
impulse to theological studies, from the position he occupied
in the faculty of Montauban. His faith, his learning,
and his worth, entitle him to a place in this history.</p>

<p>M. Daniel Encontre was born at Nismes in 1762. His
father, who had been one of the pastors of the desert, was
only able to bestow upon his education the rare opportunities
of leisure afforded by a wandering and restless life. But the
young Encontre did more by himself than others would have
done under the most able masters. “In him was again
witnessed the phenomenon, which had been in former times
so much admired in the youth of Pascal. Debarred from
the privilege of studying mathematics, he divined them.
Before the age of nineteen, without books, obliged to work
in secret and by stealth, his power of genius was such that
he succeeded in penetrating so far into the science as to reach
the infinitesimal calculus, the object of his astonishing aspiration.
He cultivated at the same time, and with the same
energy, under the eyes, and with his father’s consent, the
study of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages; and
his success was so surprising, particularly in the two last,
that they were soon as familiar to him as his mother
tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>He went to the academies of Lausanne and Geneva to
finish his studies, and exhibited there so much superiority,
that his fellow-students compared him to their most skilful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
professors. His religious convictions were not without their
troubles and storms; but he returned to the faith by the
avenue of doubt, and rested in it more firmly.</p>

<p>On his return to France, Encontre preached the Gospel to
the desert flocks. His success in preaching was, however,
small, because he was deficient in those physical qualities,
without which the best discourses do not engage [the attention
of] the multitude. His stature was small, his voice
husky, his action more hasty than imposing. An extinction
of voice intervened to decide the question with his conscience;
and he quitted the pulpit of the house of worship for the
chair of the academies.</p>

<p>The Revolution, which deprived so many of their lives, did
not leave his existence undisturbed. He sought an asylum
at Montpellier, where, says the biographer whom we have
quoted, “he was reduced, in order to earn his bread, to give
lessons in stone-cutting to master masons and workmen.
He who was worthy of teaching by the side of a Lagrange, a
Laharpe, or a Fourcroy, thought himself even fortunate in
being able to procure employment in the quarries.” Nor did
he forget, in these times of proscription, that he was the
minister of Jesus Christ, and at the peril of his life he celebrated
baptisms, blessed marriages, gave religious instruction,
and supported the piety of the faithful at Montpellier and in
its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>At the opening of the central schools, he presented himself
to contest for the chair of literature. Another candidate,
fearing the rivalry of M. Encontre, besought him to withdraw,
which he immediately did, and offered himself successfully
for the chair of pure mathematics. It was only such a
man, who could do such an act: his encyclopædical mind,
equally versed in literature, the sciences, and theology, was
profound and original in all. The celebrated Fourcroy has
said of him, “I have seen in France two or three heads that
might be compared with his, but I have never found one
that was superior.”</p>

<p>Appointed dean of the faculty of sciences at Montpellier,
he exercised a legitimate ascendancy, and enriched the collections
of the learned societies with many excellent papers.
A career, as peaceful as it was honourable, lay before him,
when the voice of the Reformed churches called him, in 1814,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
to the professorship of theology of Montauban. M. Encontre
sacrificed everything to a vocation pointed out to him under
the austere image of duty, and only expressed his fear that
he should be found unequal to his new task—a modesty
equalled only by his genius.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Montauban, where the double functions
of professor and dean had been confided to him, he imparted
firmness to the professorship of theology by the solidity of
his doctrine, the extent of his learning, and the authority of
his character. All acknowledged that he had a right to exact
much from every one, since he exacted more from himself.</p>

<p>Unhappily his strength was soon exhausted by the labours
of his office; yet although suffering and ill, he continued to
consecrate the remainder of his expiring life. Seeing that
his end was near, he proceeded to Montpellier, where the
ashes of his first wife and daughter reposed, and died there
on the 16th of September, 1818. “There is only one voice
in the Protestant church of France as to the irreparable loss
it has sustained,” said the editor of the <cite>Archives of Christianity</cite>,
on the announcement of this sorrowful news.</p>

<p>M. Daniel Encontre engaged himself upon philosophical
and religious subjects in some sketches which obtained
deserved success. His letter to M. Combe-d’Ounous on
Plato, and his dissertation upon the true system of the world
compared with the Mosaic relation, prove that he made
profound researches upon questions, which have in all ages
most deeply interested the human mind.</p>

<p>However, French Protestantism strove to found some
new institutions. The general meeting of the Bible Society
of France was convoked on the 6th of December, 1819.
We quote the following observation from the president’s
speech, which has an historical value: “According to our
by-laws and the government authorization, the Bible
Society of Paris consists solely of Protestants. It appears,
and we ought not to complain of it, that the government has
thus invited the Reformed to make each other’s acquaintance
to edify one another, and to become more exemplary, by
intercommunication.” Such, in effect, was, next to the
essential motive of religious faith, one of the principal
objects of the members of the Bible Society under the
Restoration; namely, that of offering to the Protestants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
scattered over the face of the kingdom, without any common
organization, a central rallying-point around which they
might assemble for reciprocal assistance, an advantage of
vital importance when considered with reference to the
intrigues and encroachments of the clerical party.</p>

<p>Other associations were successively established: <em>The
Religious Tract Society</em>, in 1822; and <em>The Society for the
Encouragement of Primary Instruction among the Protestants
of France</em>, in 1829. Each of these institutions contributed
its share in fortifying and extending the empire of Christian
piety.</p>

<p>Among the men, who laboured to found these societies,
displaying as much intelligence as devotion, the Baron
Auguste de Staël should be named.</p>

<p>He was the grandson of Necker, the son of Madame de
Staël and the brother of the Duchess de Broglie. The Protestant
churches welcomed in him one of those pious laymen,
so useful in former times, who united political influence with
a Christian spirit; and they were glad, allowing for the difference
of time and circumstances, to salute him as the future
Duplessis-Mornay, or the Wilberforce of the French Reformation.</p>

<p>Born at Coppet, in the canton of Vaud, in 1790, he received
his first religious lessons from the venerable pastor Cellerier.
His biographer says: “We do not doubt that M. de
Staël owed a great part of his just ideas on religion, and of
the excellent sentiments he so early displayed, to his connection
and intimacy with this tried and faithful minister;
and we can confidently affirm that the scholar ever entertained
the liveliest and most tender remembrance of his
teacher.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The part he took in the establishment of the Bible Society
helped to develop his pious tendencies. Having accepted
the task of drawing up the Reports of the Committee, and of
going from house to house to exhort the faithful to make
sacrifices for the dissemination of the Scriptures, he learned
better to appreciate the holy books himself.</p>

<p>During a visit to England in the spring of 1822, he became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
acquainted with Wilberforce and other eminent Christians,
whose words and examples strengthened his sentiments
of piety. The <cite>Letters upon England</cite>, which he published in
1825, give but an imperfect idea of the observations he collected
upon this subject; for the author confined himself
to a treatise upon the religion and the Christian communions
of Great Britain in a volume which he was not able to
complete.</p>

<p>M. de Staël applied his zeal and efforts to several labours
that might be called <em>mixed</em>, because, although evangelical
faith lay at the base, their object was temporal improvement.
We may mention among them the foundation of
Savings-banks, popular elementary instruction, and the abolition
of the slave-trade.</p>

<p>No one has forgotten the shudder of indignation which he
excited at a general meeting of the <em>Society of Christian
Morality</em>, when he exhibited the instruments of torture used
in that abominable traffic. He did more. “From hall to
hall, from office to office, from palace to palace,” says one of
his biographers, “we saw him display these hideous proofs
of the most atrocious cruelty and lust of gain. He brought
before the notice of the princes and princesses of the royal
family, these machines invented by the spirit of evil, and he
explained to them their bloody use. He showed them to
the peers of the realm in their places in the legislative
assembly, and to all the friends of humanity in the public
meetings of the benevolent societies.... We may,
without hesitation, assert, that it is to his generous efforts
we owe the cessation of the evil, and the change manifested
in the system of government and in the legislature on this
subject.”</p>

<p>The sympathies of M. de Staël were extended to all
classes of the oppressed, and he defended the victims of an
intolerant law in the Canton of Vaud. His writings, his
letters, his solicitations, moved every right-thinking conscience,
and if he did not succeed in procuring the repeal of
this mischievous law, he succeeded in having it more mildly
applied.</p>

<p>His character offered a rare mixture of earnestness and
caution, of zeal and moderation. So great was his integrity,
that it frequently prevented him from speaking to the extent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
of his religious convictions, from the fear of overstepping
them. No one understood better than himself how difficult
it is, in the midst of social affairs and relations, to make
one’s life conform unerringly to the precepts of the Gospel.
“This want of harmony between his life and his religion,”
says the editor of his works, “was an insupportable load,
under which he languished, and his very physiognomy bore
the impress of this mental anguish. But by degrees his
mind was calmed by the Christian faith, at once so consoling
and so pure, which, without detracting from the
beauty of the moral type which should be the object of our
endeavours, teaches us to turn our eyes from our own misery
to fix them upon that one divine, holy, and just Being, who
has accomplished everything for us.”</p>

<p>The Baron de Staël died at the Château de Coppet, on the
17th of November, 1827, when only thirty-seven years
of age.</p>

<p>The attention and the labours of the pious were also
directed, during the Restoration, towards the scattered Protestants,
who were threatened with the loss of their religious
belief and habits, by the distance of their dwellings from
regular pastoral action. The greatest of these new Evangelists
was undoubtedly Félix Neff, who was born at Geneva,
in 1798. Although a stranger to the Reformed churches of
our country by his birthplace, he belongs to them by his
missionary career; for it is in Dauphiny, more than elsewhere,
that he spread the seeds of the Gospel, and he has been
justly called the Oberlin of the Upper Alps.</p>

<p>Neff was not covetous of glory, and it is probable that
the idea of a distinguished name never presented itself to
his mind, when he went to expound the Bible in the huts
of the poor mountaineers. Yet no name of the French Reformation
in our day has been so famous as his: numerous
original writings and a host of translations have been published
concerning his life. In the heart of Germany, in the
most distant valleys of Scotland, on the borders of the Orinoco
and the Ohio, the name of Félix Neff is pronounced,
and thousands of voices will re-echo, “He was a mighty
servant of the Lord.”</p>

<p>In his youth he was fond of reading Plutarch and Rousseau;
he studied mathematics and the natural sciences, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
distinguished himself by the manliness of his character, as
much as by the powers of his mind. Enrolled at seventeen
years of age in the artillery of Geneva, his approach to the
principles of Christianity was slow; but when he had once
embraced them, he never quitted them. He immediately
quitted the military service, and travelled through several of
the Swiss cantons, preaching the Gospel from place to place.
Thence he entered the department of Isère, and in 1823
went to the Upper Alps.</p>

<p>There, in the deep gorges, or upon peaks covered with
eternal snow, dwells a population which, it is said, dates back
by its symbols and its religious creed, to the primitive Christians
of the Gauls. They form a link, not only with the
disciples of Pierre Valdo, but with the apostolate of Irenæus,
the second bishop of Lyons.</p>

<p>These Christians of Dauphiny, exposed to cruel persecutions,
and continually straitened as the authority of Rome
gradually more closely encircled them, had taken refuge from
rock to rock, from mountain height to height, as far as the
extreme limit where man can exist in the rarefied air. They
had carried with them their Bible, their confessions of faith,
and that firm piety, which welcomes the most terrible tortures
in preference to apostasy. When the Reformation
appeared, they saluted it as a sister of their ancient communion,
and joined the churches of Dauphiny and Provence.</p>

<p>Neff discovered in the valleys of Fressinières and Queyras,
at Triève, Lacombe, Dormillouse, villages hung upon the
precipitous slopes of the Alps, the remnants of this faithful
race. Without schools, without fixed pastors or regular
religious service, they were left to live upon their pious recollections
rather than upon a personal and active faith. Neff,
by God’s help, restored this to them; and, a missionary at
the same time of civilization and Christianity, he became
their schoolmaster, and their instructor in agriculture, engineering,
and surveying; the first in the field to labour, the
last to quit the offices of prayer, he devoted himself wholly
to this people whom he served.</p>

<p>Three years and a half passed in these pursuits of fraternal
love. Félix Neff sheltered his head now under the roof of
one cabin, now under another, never sleeping three nights
following in the same resting-place. His parish was fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
leagues in length, and comprised twelve annexed districts.
He visited them in winter and summer alike, wading through
the snow knee-deep, taking long circuitous routes to pass the
glaciers, eating the black bread of the inhabitants, preaching
in the barns, and opening schools in the stables. Such devotion
was not permitted to be fruitless. The mountaineers of
the Alps awoke at the voice of the apostle. “The rocks,
nay, the very glaciers,” he wrote, “all seemed animated, and
presented a smiling aspect; the savage country became
agreeable and dear to me from the moment its inhabitants
were my brethren.”</p>

<p>But his health, however robust, gave way beneath the
burthen, and in this sublime contest between charity and
physical suffering, his frame broke down. Félix Neff was
compelled to quit the Alps to behold them no more; he died
in the month of April, 1829, in his native town.</p>

<p>He has left but few writings—one or two fragments of sermons,
some pious meditations, and letters, which have been collected
and printed. He was rather a man of action than of
study, and he might have addressed to the writers on religion
the saying of a great citizen of antiquity to a philosopher:
“That which you speak, I do.”</p>

<p>However rich Protestant literature may have been under
the Restoration, if judged by the number of its works, it is
poor in original books of any value. Translations and reprints
were numerous. English authors figure principally in the
first category: Bogue, Chalmers, Paley, Thomas Scott, Erskine,
Milner, Miss Kennedy, and others. In the second we
meet with the works of Nardin, Saurin, Court, Duplessis-Mornay,
Dumoulin, Claude, and Drelincourt. The <cite lang="fr">Mémoire</cite>
of M. Alexandre Vinet in favour of religious liberty, the <cite lang="fr">Vues
sur le Protestantisme en France</cite> of M. Samuel Vincent, and
the <cite lang="fr">Musée des Protestants célèbres</cite>, an unfinished work, are
distinguished by different kinds of merit from the mass of
the forgotten books of that period.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_VII">VII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Protestants took no active part, as Protestants, in the
Revolution of 1830; but they generally hailed its occurrence
with joy, because it brought them new pledges of security for
the free exercise of their worship. We have witnessed how their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
vexations, annoyances, and exclusions were multiplied towards
the end of the reign of Charles X.; and if their political
rights, consecrated by the Charter, had fallen beneath the
ordinances of July, to what perilous attacks might not
religious liberty, which rested upon the same foundation,
have been exposed? Many persons believed [that it would
have been so exposed]; and without crediting the reports
circulated at the time among the popular masses concerning
projects of persecution against the Protestants, it is probable
that their position would have been greatly aggravated.</p>

<p>This explains the satisfaction which they exhibited at the
news of the three days’ victory. Yet this contentment was
calm, reserved, and without the least thought of reprisals,
and perfect harmony between the two Churches was nowhere
disturbed, except at Nismes, where it seems as if the religious
communions must always experience the consequences of
political events.</p>

<p>The Protestants were not the aggressors. Far from this;
for in the very first days of the month of August, an appeal
to union was published, having the full adhesion of all the
respectable portion of the community, without distinction of
creed, and the pastors went from family to family, everywhere
recommending forgetfulness of the crimes of 1815.
Their voice was listened to. A multitude of Protestant
workmen, accompanied by a great number of (Roman) Catholics,
entered the public square, pronouncing words of
reconciliation, and formed a procession that marched round
the city, uttering cries of <i lang="fr">Vive l’union!</i> <i lang="fr">Vive la paix!</i>
(Long live union! Long live peace!)</p>

<p>But some rioters of the lowest class of the people, led
partly by fanaticism, and partly, perhaps, by the dread of the
account that justice might require of them for their past
excesses, returned to Nismes, on the 15th of August, with
suspicious-looking strangers, after having sought a refuge at
Beaucaire, and their presence was the occasion of unfortunate
collisions. Happily several companies of courageous countrymen
came down from Vaunage, and intimidated this seditious
band. On the side of the (Roman) Catholics two were
killed and six wounded, and on the side of the Protestants six
were killed and twenty-eight wounded. The last had therefore
furnished three or four times more victims than they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
had made; the French Reformation had been accustomed to
suffer in this way for three hundred years past.</p>

<p>In revising the Charter, the Chamber of Deputies abrogated
the 6th article, upon the religion of the state, and re-adopted
the terms of the <i lang="fr">Concordat</i> upon the religion of the
majority of the French. In doing this, there was much less
desire to give satisfaction to Protestantism than to the
opinion excited against the usurpation of the clerical power.
M. Dupin explained this very clearly in his report. “The
expressions of the 6th article,” he said, “have awakened impudent
pretensions to an exclusive domination, as much
opposed to religion as to the freedom of conscience and the
peace of the kingdom. A threefold interest demands the
erasure of terms which, without adding anything to what
religion will always possess of the holy and venerable in our
eyes, had become the source of many errors, and, finally,
caused the disgrace of the reigning family, and brought the
state to the brink of ruin.”</p>

<p>Two months afterwards, M. Dupin, then procurator-general
at the Court of Cassation, who has since maintained different
opinions, demanded true conditions of religious liberty.
The question was still the same; namely, whether it required
the permission of the authorities or a simple preliminary declaration,
before opening a new place of worship and forming
regular assemblies of Protestants in communes, where none
had ever before existed. It was the important question of a
preventative or a repressive <i lang="fr">régime</i>, of censorship or of
liberty, of the arbitrary intervention of power in religious
matters, or of the independence of believers.</p>

<p>M. Dupin also said, respecting the affair of the Protestants
of Levergies (and his words are still worthy of quotation),
“He who wills the end, wills the means. What avails a
proclaimed liberty, if the means of its enjoyment be denied?
What! The free exercise of worship is permitted, and at
the same time there is a prohibition to exercise it in every
place! The exercise is to be interdicted in the streets and
public squares: that would shock other creeds. And when
its exercise is asked for in any special edifice, it is forbidden!
Such liberty is a mockery! What is the obligation
thus imposed of obtaining permission to celebrate one’s
worship, but tantamount to the preliminary censorship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
applied to the freedom of the press?... In the actual
condition of our constitutional legislation, I can conceive
that the administrative authority has a right to keep a watch
upon the exercise of worship, as upon every other kind of
assembly; a right to inquire into and punish offences arising
out of this exercise, and by this very fact the utility of a
preliminary declaration to prepare the authorities. But I
can admit neither the peremptory right of refusal, nor the
silence equivalent to this refusal, as a lawful means of preventing
citizens from exercising their religious worship with
full liberty. This liberty is not subject to preliminary
authorization; it is not subordinated to optional permission
any more for those, who are not Catholics, than for those
who are so.” (October, 1830.)</p>

<p>The external condition of the French Reformation seemed
therefore more favourable than it had ever been, and we may
read in the Protestant journals of the day how full of hope
they were. There were to be no longer any direct or indirect
inequality between the two communions, or obstacles of any
kind to the manifestation of the Reformed faith! There
was thenceforth to be an end to the necessity of waiting
about the antechamber of priest-led prefects to solicit their
authorization in ecclesiastical matters, or about the office of
a minister, governed by political calculations! The ill-will
of a mayor or a royal procurator was not to be any longer
sufficient to dissolve religious meetings, and the tribunals
would not punish the prayers of a few peaceable men out-numbering
the perilous figure of twenty persons, as if they
were crimes! We shall soon see how completely their expectations
were deceived.</p>

<p>Many Protestants thought that the occasion was propitious
for demanding the alteration of the law of the 18th Germinal.
It appeared to them that a government sprung
from the triumph of liberal ideas could not, without self-contradiction,
maintain a law which had been inspired by an
excessive reaction against all liberty. Complaints and
petitions to this effect were presented to the ministers of
Louis Philippe; but they were thrown aside. If the popular
origin of the government were a means, it was also an
obstacle. The new power, conscious of its weakness and
want of solidity, would not increase the difficulties of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
position by meddling with the ecclesiastical questions, and it
adopted as a rule of conduct in these matters, to make no
change unless under absolute necessity.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been [a matter] of more easy settlement,
had the question been one of mere Protestantism. To
grant better laws to a small minority, ought to have given little
umbrage. But behind the Protestant community were the
(Roman) Catholics, with a discontented clergy, secretly hostile,
and hating the organic articles even more than the consistories.
If anything were granted to the former, nothing
could be refused to the latter; and expediency forbade the aggravation
of the troubles of the State by those of the Church.</p>

<p>The government, therefore, refused to make the least
change in the law. Whereupon another question presented
itself. Leaving the organic articles intact, was it not possible
to have deduced more liberal applications from them, and
to have given a less dependent position to Protestantism?
The intervention of the legislative bodies was not necessary
in this case; the discussion might be carried on with closed
doors; the consistories and the minister of public worship
might arrange everything, and a simple royal ordinance
would suffice. Several consistories insisted upon this point;
pastoral conferences drew up programmes for the administration
of the Reformed churches; the government itself nominated
a commission to prepare the draft of the ordinance,
and there was finally a prospect of something favourable to
the Reformed.</p>

<p>Expectation was again deceived. The new regulation
drawn up by this commission, instead of extending liberty,
seemed to restrict it to still narrower limits than before;
and the minister of public worship encountered the most
energetic opposition from the consistories, when he consulted
them upon it. The government ceased to do any more, and
the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of 1802 remained in its entirety.</p>

<p>In other respects, according to the genius of the middle
classes, who directed public affairs at this time, the material,
or pecuniary side of the situation of the Reformed churches,
not only suffered no attack, but was sensibly ameliorated.
The majority of the pastors received augmented allowances,
new places were created, and funds for building places of
worship and opening schools were granted with liberality.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
All this is mentioned with gratitude. Nothing was refused
that money can accomplish for the development of a religious
communion.</p>

<p>It must also be said in honour of Louis Philippe’s government,
that it never sought to mix itself up with the internal
questions of the churches, when its intervention was not
sought by the churches themselves. If it decreed the removal
of some pastors, and did other acts which ought not
to depend upon the decision of the civil power, it was unwillingly,
and after long delays [that it did so]. Protestantism
might have been much more free under this reign, if it
had seriously striven to become so.</p>

<p>But beyond the official region, barriers and fetters of all
kinds soon reappeared, as in the reign of Charles X.; sometimes,
indeed, there seemed to be a stronger desire to offer
obstruction, and scarcely was one cause of litigation on
account of religion settled, before another sprung up.</p>

<p>After the Revolution, the most zealous of the Protestants
judged that the moment had arrived for multiplying their
labours of proselytism. Considered from the point of view
of liberty and the equality of creeds, this was their right;
and considered from that of their personal convictions, it was
their duty. When proselytism employs such means only as
are peaceful and authorized by universal morality, no human
power can legitimately interdict it.</p>

<p>Circumstances appeared favourable. Public opinion was
deeply hostile to the clerical party; it accused them of having
deceived the conscience of an aged king to make him
violate his oath, and overthrow the liberties of the nation.
The external signs of (Roman) Catholicism fell in every
direction before the popular cry; the churches were deserted,
and the priests felt so well the discredit in which they stood,
that for several years they kept themselves aloof, never
showing themselves except when absolutely obliged, never
raising a dispute, uttering a word, or asking anything but to
be forgotten at the foot of their altars.</p>

<p>This was not all. Philosophical systems and social theories
were boldly propounded to the country under the sacred
name of religion, and were preached with great applause.
Saint Simonism, among others, had its journals, its public
meetings, its worship, its hierarchy, its missionaries, its committees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
of propagandism: we mention the fact without contesting
the right: the Saint Simonians were entitled to
liberty, to as much liberty as the Reformed and the (Roman)
Catholics, of gaining proselytes by the channel of persuasion.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that the fervent members of
the Protestant faith would not consent to be shut up in their
places of worship, while antichristian and vicious doctrines,
in their eyes, were openly propagated. Conscience imposed
upon them the imperious and holy obligation of addressing
themselves immediately both to the deserters from the
(Roman) Catholic church—an immense multitude, wandering
hither and thither without spiritual guides—and to the disciples
of the schools, who had, as it appeared to them, but
the empty appearance of a religion. It was not so much an
idea of aggression against (Roman) Catholicism as a testimony
of sympathy for the souls which had no longer religious
belief of any kind.</p>

<p>They had also another object in view, of secondary consequence
to the religious conscience, but still important,—this
was to strengthen order, threatened by the political revolutions.
These Protestants believed that a vague spiritualism
could not imbue a free people with those morals which must
sustain the noble burthen of the laws, and that this required
a strong and positive faith, the faith, which they themselves
possessed.</p>

<p>Hence the origin, for a part of French Protestantism, of
a whole series of publications, associations, and Christian institutions,
in the general sense of this word. A journal,
rearing alone the standard of the Gospel, the <cite>Sower</cite>, appeared
in the month of September, 1831. Chapels, unsalaried by
the State, were opened about the same time at Paris and
elsewhere. In 1833 an <em>evangelical society</em> was established,
with the intention of announcing to all indifferently, what
they held to be the essential truths of Christianity. We
might mention some other institutions conceived in the same
spirit.</p>

<p>These labours were not trammelled in the beginning. But
the (Roman) Catholic clergy having gradually recovered their
strength, the government thought it expedient to make
approaches to them, and endeavoured to conciliate them by
favours of a nature alien to the establishment of 1830. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
is not our duty to examine whether the government of Louis
Philippe did not lose more than it gained by this policy.
What it is important for us to say is, that it impeded the
work of proselytism according to the measure of its relations
with the sacerdotal body.</p>

<p>Considering certain acts and prosecutions, it might even
have been supposed, that there was something passing analogous
to what had been seen in former times. All the historians
have remarked that Henry IV., on his advent to the
throne, and Louis XIV., when he had disputed with the
Holy See, redoubled their severity against the Protestants,
because they felt it incumbent upon them to wipe away the
suspicion of heresy. The same cause, in its due proportion,
and allowing for the great difference of the periods, produced
similar effects under the reign of Louis Philippe. This prince
had to dissipate the distrust of the priests, to win their
sympathies; and in one sense, he dreaded more than ever
Charles X. had done, giving Protestants a free field, because
the clergy would have been more prompt in accusing him of
connivance with them. The marriage of the heir to the
crown with a Protestant prince (a descendant, it is said, of
Admiral Coligny), instead of improving matters, made them
worse.</p>

<p>Things were now carried farther than instituting suits
against those, who opened new places of worship, than invoking
the restrictive articles of the penal code against them,
as under the Restoration, and applying the dispositions of the
law of 1834 respecting associations, although the minister of
justice and public worship had solemnly promised the
Chambers not to turn them against religious societies; but
even the right of controversy, that was exercised under the
<i lang="fr">régime</i> of the Edict of Nantes, was called in question, and a
certain prefectorial order actually assumed to fix—as in the
time of Charles IX. and Catherine de Medicis—the number
of persons authorized to participate in the Protestant religion.
Even more, legally constituted Protestantism had to
maintain contests to preserve the right of visiting its own
members in the hospitals, prisons, and other public establishments;
and the authorities proceeded sometimes so far as to
impose arbitrary bounds to preaching among the scattered
Protestants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span></p>

<p>These iniquitous proceedings, which it would be just to
attribute more particularly to subordinate and ignorant
functionaries, provoked energetic remonstrances. A society
was formed, under the name of the general interests of French
Protestantism, to protect the freedom and equality of creeds.
All the pastors of Paris, without exception, complained of
the conduct of the civil power. The national tribunal resounded
with these grievances. Some eminent men of the
Protestant communion, MM. Pelet de la Lozère, François
Delessert, and Agénor de Gasparin, were the medium of
communication; the Opposition supported them, and the
minister promised that the Reformed should be more justly
treated.</p>

<p>He kept his word in some respects. Legal Protestantism
might accomplish its mission among its people, without as
well as within; but evangelical proselytism met with never-ceasing
obstacles until the end of the royalty of 1830. It is
sad to say, that not a single government in France, whatever
may have been its origin, has yet known how to sanction the
practical exercise of religious liberty in its full extent. We
may be unbelievers, but we are not yet free to proclaim
our faith, or to celebrate our worship according to our consciences.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the resistance of the government, the
Reformed doctrine gained ground in many places. A certain
number of (Roman) Catholics, and even some priests, embraced
Protestantism. New churches were added to the old
ones, some attaching themselves to the established organization,
others preserving an independent position. Yet the
importance of these successes must not be exaggerated. In
our times the vital forces of the people seem to be absorbed
by political pre-occupations and material interests, and it
must be confessed that the great majority of Frenchmen have
too little faith to change their religion.</p>

<p>The attempt at proselytism on either side would, as a
natural consequence, increase the ardour of controversy.
This argumentative warfare was in effect carried on without
cessation; and we might cite a long list of writings upon
matters disputed between the two communions, from 1830
to 1848. Some of these publications are dressed in a popular
form that has gained them numerous readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span></p>

<p>The same epoch affords examples, from time to time, of an
odious intolerance; but they were only private and isolated
acts. These were the abduction of young girls, refusal of burial
in the communal cemetery, profanation of tombs, sequestration
of the sick, accusations against several agents of the
evangelical societies. The hand of the priests and the nuns
was often suspected, and in certain cases was detected with
incontrovertible evidence. The responsibility of these acts
must fall only upon some fanatical and ignorant individuals.
The respectable people of the (Roman) Catholic communion
were indignant at them, and the judiciary or administrative
authority protected the rights of the minority, although it
deserves the reproach of pursuing and punishing the true
criminals too leniently.</p>

<p>The last years of the reign of Louis Philippe were disturbed
by an affair which deeply moved the Protestants of
France, although it was connected in a very indirect manner
with their relations to the State. The armed invasion of the
island of Tahiti revealed to the world the extreme complaisance
of the government for the clerical party, and at the
same time the danger of subordinating the temporal power
to the maxims of the Romish church. This attack upon the
rights of nations narrowly escaped rupturing the alliance
with England, compromised the name of France before all
civilized nations, sensibly augmented the strength of the
opposition, and threw the ministry into difficulties of embarrassment,
from which it was never able to recover itself
A lesson so severe and so grave ought not to be lost!</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 id="BV_VIII">VIII.</h3>
</div>


<p>The internal situation of the Protestants under the royalty
of July, will one day furnish the historian with abundant
subjects of research and reflection.</p>

<p>Two questions in which, if we consider them attentively,
all the others concentred, were particularly debated—the
question of the confessions of faith, and that of the separation
of Church and State.</p>

<p>Ought the churches of the Reformation to have a written
and obligatory confession upon the fundamental articles of
faith? Or ought they to propound the Bible alone as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
rule of faith and teaching? Historically considered, the
question would soon be decided, since French Protestantism
has existed under the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of a dogmatic formulary from
the year 1559 until 1802. But this fact, however important,
could resolve nothing; for the Reformation does not
declare itself immutable, and has constantly retained the
right of altering its mode of organization, upon the sole
condition of respecting the sovereign authority of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>The vehement and often resumed polemical controversy
that resulted from this discussion had already begun before
1830; it was renewed under Louis Philippe, and has not yet
terminated. Partisans and adversaries of the confessions of
faith alike invoke the testimony of the Bible; but the former
are above all things anxious for the interest of unity of doctrine,
the latter for the right of examination and freedom.
The first do not understand how there can be a church in
the true acceptation of the term, when the pulpit is open to
contradictory teachings; the second are equally ignorant
how Protestantism can be subjected to a rule that no longer
allows every one to form his belief for himself, Bible in
hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if we were to probe this debate somewhat more
deeply, we should find that these differences of opinion
depend still more upon the manner of understanding the
Gospel than of confessing it. The defenders of written
creeds see essential points where their adversaries distinguish
only simple shades, and that which is the whole of Christianity
for the one, is for the others nothing more than a
particular and fallible interpretation.</p>

<p>Two men, who have wielded a legitimate influence, MM.
Stapfer and Samuel Vincent, maintained opposite theses in
this controversy.</p>

<p>M. Philippe Albert Stapfer, a native of Berne, had become
a Frenchman by long residence in the country, and by his
constant sympathies for the Protestants of France. He
brought them what they had long wanted since the seventeenth
century,—theological learning, drawn from the best
sources of Christian antiquity and the Reformation.</p>

<p>A part of his career was employed in important political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span>
and diplomatic affairs. Appointed minister of public instruction
and worship in his own country, at the period when
the Directory had erected Switzerland into a Unitarian
republic, M. Stapfer displayed great zeal for the intellectual
development of the people, and a generous courage
against the pretensions of the foreigner. Afterwards called
to fill the post of ambassador to Buonaparte, he defended as
long as possible, and with noble firmness, the independence
of the Swiss cantons against the growing exactions of the
conqueror of Marengo.</p>

<p>These laborious negotiations did not prevent him from
devoting long hours to study. He followed with attentive
eye the learned theology and the philosophy of Germany
in all their scientific evolutions, and he prescribed it to himself
as a duty even in his waning years, to keep pace with
modern ideas.</p>

<p>Eminent by his learning, M. Stapfer was not less distinguished
for his faith. These two great forces of human
existence afforded mutual assistance to this elevated person.
Unfortunately he has written but little; his weak health
did not permit him to remain long at the desk. Some
sketches and a few discourses constitute the greater part of
his works. They have been collected in two volumes, with
a biographical notice by M. Vinet, in the form of an apology,
which has been given to the world with the affection of
respect, and with an unusual discernment.</p>

<p>M. Stapfer devoted himself most earnestly to the labours
of the principal associations of Protestantism. He had great
moral influence in these societies. His clear mind, elevated
views, benevolent character, firmness on important occasions,
nobility of sentiment and intention, all endued his words
with an authority to which it was honourable to submit.
This faithful servant of the Gospel died on the 27th of
March, 1840.</p>

<p>M. Samuel Vincent was born at Nismes in 1787; he was
the son and grandson of pastors of the desert, and had
derived from his paternal traditions, a profound attachment
to the Reformed communion, cemented with the blood of
martyrs, and which has withstood so many storms. One
may differ from the ideas, which this learned pastor entertained
upon some articles of dogma and discipline; but no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
one can dispute his firm and invariable desire to bring the
scattered members of the great body of the French Reformation
together, and to instil into it, with the divine blessing,
new seeds of life. M. Vincent faithfully reproduced
the expression, the tendencies, and the character of the
Protestants of the south, who have shown so much steadfastness
and heroism in the days of persecution, and who had
already, towards the end of the sixteenth century, distinguished
themselves from the Protestants of the north.</p>

<p>After completing his studies at Geneva, he was appointed
to the ministry of the Reformed church at Nismes, like his
father and grandfather. He won distinction by the variety
of his acquirements, the urbanity of his private life, and his
zeal in exciting a useful activity around him. He was a
man of meditation and impulse, ever ready most freely to
dispense the valuable thoughts which he had gathered, and
willingly surrendered to others the honour of the initiative,
which he had given them.</p>

<p>From 1820 to 1824 he published, in the form of a periodical
collection, <cite lang="fr">Mélanges de Religion, de Morale, et de Critique</cite>,
with the particular object of initiating the French pastors in
the movement of German theology during the last eighty
years. The task was ungrateful. It was in a manner
necessary to create his auditory before he could instruct
them, and M. Vincent had occasion to convince himself that
it is sometimes more difficult to inspire the taste for science,
than to communicate science itself.</p>

<p>When M. de Lamennais attacked Protestantism with all
the vehemence of his genius, the pastor of Nismes answered
him by his <cite lang="fr">Observations sur la Voie d’Autorité appliquée à la
Religion</cite>. Less skilful as a writer than his illustrious adversary,
he maintained a better cause and defended it by more
solid arguments. It is to be regretted that M. de Lamennais
should have assumed a disdainful superiority in his
reply, forgetting that in such a debate, victory is not won
by haughtiness of language, but by soundness of reasoning.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to cite the <cite>Views upon
Protestantism in France</cite>, a work in which M. Vincent has
embodied his reflections upon the principal questions of
doctrine and ecclesiastical organization. This book bears
evidence of a strong and independent mind, and yet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
author does not appear to have displayed all the powers
which he possesses; it is the first effort of a great intellect
and a generous heart.</p>

<p>M. Vincent died on the 10th of July, 1837; (Roman)
Catholics and Protestants joined in following to his last
resting-place [the remains of] a man, who had reflected
honour at once upon Protestantism and his country.</p>

<p>The second question, agitated among the Protestants after
1830, concerned, as we have said, the separation of Church
and State. The Revolution of 1789 made a distinction between
the temporal and the spiritual [powers]. It confined
the priest to his proper domain, the magistrate to his, and it
separated the citizen from the believer. But is it right to
go to this extent? Ought the State to regard the Church or
the churches, as no more than private societies, free institutions,
which exist under the common right of protection
by conforming to the general laws, and without receiving any
salary for their ministers? Or ought the State to treat with
these institutions, to confer upon them an official character
by its alliance, and to place them, with reference to other
associations, in a privileged position? The question is one
of vast importance; it involves the entire notions of Church
and State, and the manner of resolving it affects the gravest
problems of religion and politics. It is not difficult to understand
that men of equal enlightenment, sincerity, and piety,
may adopt entirely different opinions in this controversy. It
has engaged (Roman) Catholicism as well as Protestantism.
MM. de Lamennais and de Lamartine have both pronounced
for the complete separation of the two powers. The
same thesis has been maintained in the Protestant communion
by a thinker of the highest order, whose name deserves
a place among the greatest—M. Vinet, who, although not
belonging to the French Reformation either by birth, or
by way of naturalization or domicile, has written for it, and
influenced it, and therefore a few lines concerning him will
not be out of place.</p>

<p>M. Alexandre Vinet was born in a village of the canton
of Vaud. He was educated at Lausanne, and while still
young filled the chair of literature in the University of Basle.
This was a happy position for a mind like his; for, placed
upon the frontier of the two principal civilizations of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
continent, he could take from either what was most excellent,
stamping it at the same time with the seal of that
manly independence which is instinctively acquired in the
most ancient republic of Europe. He received learning from
Germany, precision of judgment and language from France,
the sentiment of liberty from his own country, the faith that
purifies and corrects everything from the Gospel; and out
of these different elements his eminently original genius composed
an harmonious whole, which it is more easy to name
than to describe.</p>

<p>As a critic, few writers of the present day have equalled,
and none have surpassed him, at least in the essential conditions
of the art. He loved to discover and vindicate the
beauties of literary works rather than to point out their defects,
and one might occasionally wonder at the praises, with
which he sometimes dignified mediocre writings, were it not
that he naturally delighted in the good and the beautiful,
and that wherever he encountered the palest image of these
[features], he made it lustrous by the contact of his own intellect.
M. Vinet lauded in others, without knowing it, the
merits that he had imparted to them.</p>

<p>His style has been appreciated in these terms by M.
Sainte Beuve, one of the most competent judges that could
be named on such a subject: “He possesses” [says M. Sainte
Beuve] “an originality which reproduces and condenses the
qualities of French Switzerland in the most happy manner,
and at the same time his language is generally excellent, of
Attic turn, and redolent with choicest flowers.... If I
might venture to express my actual thought, I should say
that, after M. Daunou for the ancient school, after M. Villemain
for the modern, he is, in my judgment, of all French
writers, the one who has best analyzed the models, sifted
and deciphered the language, fathomed its limits and its
centre, and noted its various and veritable acceptations.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>As a preacher, he broke through the old forms of the
sermon, and identified himself with the auditor of the nineteenth
century, without quitting by one step the territory of
Christianity, or rather by shielding so much the more efficaciously
the principle of unity in the Gospel that he made just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
concessions to that of diversity. “There was in his oratory,”
says an author, “something characteristically innate and
powerful.... At first he sought to restrain himself,
but the tone soon rose; his speech became more rapid; his
sonorous voice elicited in every accent the emotion of which
it was full, and the care he took to keep himself out of consideration,
to disappear behind the truths he announced,
only served to render talents so pure, so true, and so original,
more prominent.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> As a Christian, he belonged to the
family of Pascal by the penetration and the profundity of his
thought, and to the family of Fénélon by the mild and simple
candour of his faith. One thing surpassed even his piety
and genius—humility. How could a man be so completely
ignorant of the qualities of his own heart, who discerned
those of others so well? It is that he judged others by his
heart, and himself with his conscience. He had all the complaisance
of charity for them, and all the severity of the
ideal for himself.</p>

<p>M. Alexandre Vinet rendered his soul to God on the 4th
of May, 1847. He left many disciples, but he has not up to
the present time had a successor.</p>

<p>The Protestant press was enriched with several works of
real merit during the reign of Louis Philippe. The history
of the Reformation has been treated with remarkable talent.
The pulpit reckoned many excellent models. Periodical
literature was not without worth; and if France has given
little heed to these labours, it is perhaps less the fault of
the Protestant preachers and writers than of hereditary
prejudices, that still weigh upon Protestantism itself in
France.</p>

<p>Many benevolent institutions were established during this
period, and supported by voluntary contributions. Orphans,
the aged, the sick, children destitute of instruction, those
whom justice has condemned, and other unfortunates besides,
became the object of an active and liberal solicitude, and
afforded their testimony in behalf of that Protestantism,
which is depreciated only by those, who do not understand
it.</p>

<p>The religious societies, properly speaking, continued their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span>
labours, and received considerable additions to their funds.
The Bible, disseminated by the hand of <i lang="fr">colporteurs</i>, as in
the beginning of the French Reformation, spread light and
life in every direction. The scattered Protestants were appealed
to, gathered together, and instructed. The Evangelical
Society increased every year the number of its agents.
The Missionary Society sent zealous servants of the Gospel
to the south of Africa, who carried to the wild tribes who
peopled it, the most useful arts of civilized nations, together
with the promises of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Among those, who exhibited the greatest zeal and devotion
for the conversion of the heathen, the name of Admiral Ver-Huell
must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>A native of Holland, he had become a Frenchman by his
great military services, and by the letters of naturalization
which rewarded them. At the camp of Boulogne he was
intrusted with the organization of the Batavian fleet, and
gave striking proofs of cool intrepidity, intelligence, and
bravery, in several encounters. He led a <i lang="fr">corps-d’armée</i>
through the English fleet, that poured upon his squadron the
projectiles of nine hundred guns. This heroic act gave entire
confidence to the hundred and sixty thousand men collected
upon the borders of the ocean.</p>

<p>Napoleon entertained the highest esteem for Admiral
Ver-Huell, and it was to his keeping that he desired to intrust
his person and his fortunes after the disaster of Waterloo,
so that he might escape to America. This was refused
to the Admiral for some frivolous reason. “If this charge
had been confided to Ver-Huell, as I had been promised,”
said the prisoner of St. Helena, “I believe we should have
succeeded.”</p>

<p>Admiral Ver-Huell was made a minister of state, an ambassador,
and a peer of France; but we will pass over his political
career: his religious life alone belongs to this work. The
celebrated sailor was one of the most active members of all
the religious societies, which he aided with his purse, his
example, and the authority of his name. He particularly
took a paternal interest in the children of the Missionary
House, and watched them with affectionate eye in their distant
and perilous apostolate.</p>

<p>He was president of the Missionary Society, and the anniversary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
of the general meetings was always welcomed by him
with pleasure. “What pure and simple joy beamed in his
countenance,” says a writer well acquainted with him, “when
the deputations from the auxiliary societies, or some friend
of missions, assured the committee of their sympathy for
the work, and congratulated him with Christian thankfulness.
How truly and deeply felt was the speech that he
was accustomed to deliver at the opening of the session.
Eighteen times in twenty-three years did he fill the chair at
the general meeting, and on every occasion he delivered an
address, which bore the impress of his pious heart and energetic
soul....</p>

<p>“When a friend entered his house, his face, that we had
never once seen clouded, suddenly lighted up. His look
brightened, his voice assumed a peculiar accent of mildness;
in every demonstration of his friendship one felt at the same
time the frank heartiness of the sailor, the dignity of the
general, the polish of the man of the world, the simplicity
and truth of the Christian.... Goodness pervaded
all his sentiments, his character, his whole life; it was part
and parcel of himself; it was himself; a goodness simple,
candid, affectionate, cordial; a goodness inexhaustible in its
source and effects; a goodness disinterested in its principle
and persevering in its fruits; a goodness that never suspected
evil, and would not believe it either in men or
things.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Admiral Ver-Huell was snatched from his friends and
the Church the 25th of October, 1845, at the age of sixty-nine.</p>

<p>Some further facts in the internal movement of the
Reformed communion might be mentioned, such as the
establishment of separate flocks, the Wesleyans, Baptists,
and dissenters of several denominations. But they were
only local manifestations of no great extent, which, although
offering examples of living faith and pious devotion among
themselves, did not influence the general condition of French
Protestantism.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span></p>

<h3 id="BV_IX">IX.</h3>
</div>


<p>We have now reached the end of our task. The Revolution
of 1848 has as yet exercised no considerable action upon
the Reformed communion, taken as a whole. If during the
past three years the Protestants of France have held assemblies
whereat new projects of ecclesiastical organization have
been framed, nothing has as yet been actually accomplished.</p>

<p>The provisional government, pre-engaged with so many
other matters, did not touch religious affairs. It only
passed a decree declaring that all citizens detained in prison
for acts relating to the free exercise of their religion, should
be immediately set at liberty, and that all fines which they
had been condemned to pay, should be remitted. This was
a homage rendered, as the preamble expressed, to the most
precious and the most sacred of all liberties.</p>

<p>The only question at the same time religious and political,
which was discussed after the Revolution by the press and in
the popular assemblies, respected the separation of Church
and State. A placard posted on the walls of Paris, on the
24th of February, demanded as the wish of the people, absolute
liberty of conscience, and complete independence of the
two powers. It was known that M. de Lamartine, then at
the summit of popularity, approved of this system, and
M. de Lamennais maintained it with the utmost energy in
his new journal, <cite lang="fr">Le Peuple Constituant</cite>.</p>

<p>Those of the Protestants who were in favour of the principle
of independence, formed a <em>society for the application of
Christianity to social questions</em>, and published a placard declaring
that—“It is unjust to compel a citizen to contribute
to the expense of a worship, which he does not follow. That
the support of religious creeds should no longer be borne by
the public exchequer, but that every one should be left to
provide for the form of worship he shall have freely chosen....
Thus, religious creeds would be propagated by those
who accepted them, and there would be no more privileged
religions. Thus, the State would no longer have its attention
engaged by questions full of embarrassment or danger.
Thus, the budget would be relieved to the extent of more
than forty millions of francs. Thus, in short, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
French people would be as free and equal in religious matters,
as they are [were] in political matters.”</p>

<p>Nothing was impossible in the midst of the universal confusion
of minds and institutions. The defenders of the communions
officially recognised were kept in a state of anxious
expectation, ready to submit to separation if it were pronounced
by the Constituent Assembly, but showing their
preference for the maintenance of the union of Church and
State.</p>

<p>Some delegates of the Reformed churches assembled
spontaneously at Paris, in the month of May, 1848. They
had been in a manner convoked by the common necessities
and apprehensions. There was no regularity in the origin of
their mandates; some had been appointed by universal suffrage,
others by the consistories, or even by the presidents of
the consistories. Nor was there any proportion in the representation:
certain churches, in the neighbourhood of Paris,
reckoned five or six delegates for a single consistorial circuit;
while on the other hand, some churches had only sent one
deputy for three or four consistories. There, lastly, was no
uniformity in the powers of the delegates: some were
authorized to enter fully into a discussion of ecclesiastical
questions, and others were not. Such an assembly could
only prepare the way for a body more regularly chosen by
the members of legal Protestantism.</p>

<p>The meeting first debated the question of the relations
between Church and State, and the great majority were in
favour of preserving the alliance, reserving expressly the
dignity and liberty of the Church. An electoral regulation
was then framed for the formation of an assembly,
which might consider the affairs of the communion, with an
established title.</p>

<p>This new assembly commenced its session on the 11th of
September, 1848. The members were elected by suffrage of
two degrees, the body of the flocks having chosen the electors
intrusted with the appointment of the delegates. Each of
the ninety-two consistorial churches was invited to nominate
an ecclesiastical or a lay deputy. Only three consistories
abstained, beside the two theological facilities of Montauban
and Strasbourg, which sent no representatives. The
number of members present at the assembly was not more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
than from seventy to eighty. It was, for the rest, an entirely
non-official assembly. It received no authority from any
legal text; the government did not recognise it, and the
churches were quite free to accept its resolutions or to reject
them.</p>

<p>Long and serious questions were agitated regarding the
confessions of faith. Finally, the assembly decided, almost
unanimously, that in accordance with the wish of the generality
of the churches, it would not touch upon dogmatical
subjects, and that the question should be deferred until a
more opportune time. An address was drawn up, in which
the majority expressed its common belief, without resolving
the controverted points of doctrine in one sense or another.</p>

<p>Some of the members protested against this decision, and
withdrew. They have since formed, with the independent
congregations already in being, a new religious society, under
the name of the <em>Union of the Evangelical Churches of France</em>.
Their particular synod was opened on the 20th of August,
1849, and drew up a profession of faith, and an ecclesiastical
constitution for the flocks it represented.</p>

<p>Having avoided the questions of dogma, the general
assembly of September discussed a scheme of organization
for a legal establishment. Universal suffrage, under certain
restrictions, lay at the base of the plan; the individual
church was reconstituted as an essential element of the Presbyterian
system; the institution of the general consistories
was preserved, but made subordinate to the particular
synods; finally, as the centre and crown of the ecclesiastical
edifice, there was to be a general synod, which should meet
at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The minister of public worship, to whom this project was
communicated, applied to the churches for their opinions
upon it. The consistories, while they were unanimous in
asking for important modifications in the law of the 18th
Germinal, did not agree upon the articles of the new plan of
organization, and it is uncertain whether it will become the
object of a legislative measure.</p>

<p>While Protestantism endeavoured to modify its internal
government and its relations to the civil authority, the
national assembly discussed the constitution. It adopted
the two following articles: “Every one professes his religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
freely, and receives from the State an equal protection for
the exercise of his creed. The ministers of creeds actually
recognised by the law, and of those which shall be recognised
in future, have a right to receive support from the
State.”</p>

<p>It will be remarked that the (Roman) Catholic religion is
no longer named in the fundamental law. Not only has it
ceased to be the State religion, but it has not even preserved
the distinction given to it in the <i lang="fr">Concordat</i> of Napoleon, and
the Charter of 1830, namely, that of being the religion of
the majority of the French people. There is no privilege,
then, for (Roman) Catholicism; but a full, perfect, and absolute
equality among all the recognised creeds, in such a manner
that the constitution would be violated if the government
granted to the Romish church any pre-eminence whatsoever.
It has exhausted three centuries of efforts and
struggles to gain the inscription of this great rule of justice
upon the laws, and perhaps it has to be still better learned
and applied by the manners of the people. A nation
educated in (Roman) Catholicism practises with greater difficulty
than any other, the complete equality of religious
communions.</p>

<p>It is to be further observed, that this equality exists only
for the creeds which are, or shall be recognised by the State.
The advocates of the system of separation have not been
satisfied with it, and the question of the suppression of the
budget for the creeds continues to be mooted by some organs
of the religious and political press. It is a problem for the
future to resolve.</p>

<p>The conduct of the different governments that have presided
over the destinies of France since the Revolution of
1848, has given rise to more than one dispute, whether
on the part of the independent societies and churches, or
whether on the part of official Protestantism. But we will
not dwell upon facts that date only from yesterday. The
country is in a period of crisis and transition; nothing is
settled; and this fluctuating position explains many things,
without, however, justifying them. Let us hope that the
freedom and equality of creeds will eventually succeed in
establishing themselves in the minds of the nation, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>
have in the laws, and that they will become a sovereign
maxim of conduct for the governing and the governed.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>French Protestantism has written nearly nothing within
the last three years. It collects itself in the presence of the
great political events that are passing; it observes, it waits.
New ideas are commencing there as elsewhere. What will
be the issue? God alone knows; for us, it is sufficient to
know that God reigns. He has given to the Reformed
churches of France days of faith and of triumph; He has
protected them during long generations, against the blows of
the persecutor; and His hand, that hath guarded the fathers,
will not forsake the children.</p>

given in France to the followers of the Reformation, until the end of
the seventeenth century, and that it would not be more exact to call
them so in the former half of our history, than to designate by the name
of Frenchmen the contemporaries of Clovis. They were called in the
beginning, <em>Lutherans</em>, <em>Sacramentarians</em>, then <em>Calvinists</em>, <em>Huguenots</em>,
<em>Religionaries</em>, or <em>Those of the Religion</em>. They called themselves <em>Gospellers</em>,
the <em>Faithful</em>, the <em>Reformers</em>. The name of <em>Protestant</em> was at that time
applied only to the disciples of the Lutheran Reformation in Germany.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> There are some remarkable pages of M. Guizot’s on this subject in
the <cite lang="fr">Musée des Protestants célèbres</cite>, art. <cite>Calvin</cite>. The execution of Michel
Servet has furnished the subject of a never-ending discussion. A skilful
historian of our time, M. Mignet, has devoted to it a long and learned
dissertation. It would be wholly departing from our plan, to enter
into these details. We will confine ourselves to the indication of the
following points:—1. Servet was not an ordinary heretic; he was a
daring pantheist, and outraged the dogma of all the great Christian
communities, by saying that the God in three persons was a Cerberus, a
monster with three heads. 2. He had been already condemned to death
by the Catholic doctors at Vienne, in Dauphiny. 3. The affair was
tried, not by Calvin, but by the magistrates of Geneva; and if it be
objected, that his advice must have influenced their decision, it must be
remembered that the counsels of the other reformed Swiss cantons approved
the sentence unanimously. 4. It was of infinite importance
to the Reformation, that it should separate its cause clearly from that
of an unbeliever like Servet. The (Roman) Catholic church, which this
day accuses Calvin of having participated in his condemnation, would
have accused him still more, in the sixteenth century, had he solicited
for his acquittal.</p>

assassination, poisoning, and the utmost turpitude, had sunk into the
very lowest degree of depravity. It is they, history attests it, who
planned, advised, prepared, and finally executed in France the most
monstrous crimes of the epoch. But we are far from seeking to load
the Italian nation of to-day with this terrible responsibility: a generous
and intellectual nation, which has raised itself by its very misfortunes,
and which adversity renders doubly entitled to our respect.</p>

the people overturned the monuments of the old <i lang="fr">régime</i>. Symbols bear
before the masses the penalty of their origin and of their destination.
One example, which we may select from a thousand, will illustrate the
ardent passion of the iconoclasts of the sixteenth century. The great
church of Sainte Croix, at Orleans, had been entered in the night, and
pillaged during the first religious war. Condé and Coligny hastened to
put a stop to these disorders. The prince even pointed an arquebuse at a
soldier, who stood upon a ladder ready to break an image. “My lord,”
said the Huguenot to him, “have patience till I have broken this image,
and then let me die, if you will.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> A writer of the present day, M. Capefigue, carrying the ideas and
the passions of the nineteenth into the sixteenth century, insists that
Charles IX. and his court were coerced by the people of the markets,
and that the masses were moved by hatred against the <em>gentry</em>, or the
Huguenot aristocracy. Then applying to these allegations the system
of revolutionary fatality, he concludes that <em>no one</em> is to be blamed.
(La Réforme et la Ligue, pp. 341, 346, 361, 373, <i lang="la">et passim</i>.) Such

then, priests, either complaisant or venal enough, to bless the marriages
of the Reformed for a certain price, and without any examination. As
public opinion gradually grew satisfied with the laws against the
Calvinists, the number of these priests also increased to such an extent,
that the bargains became an open kind of traffic, of which, however,
the rich alone could avail themselves. Many of the Protestants,
besides, declined, from conscientious motives, to incur even the appearance
of hypocrisy by inscribing their marriages upon the registers of
the priests.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[149]</a> The hopes of the author, raised by the enlightened political views
of the amiable and upright Lamartine, have not been realized. The
<i lang="fr">coup-d’état</i> of December, 1851, by which Louis Napoleon rejected the
opportunity of displaying to the world that he could sacrifice personal
ambition to the patriotic observance of the oath he had sworn, to maintain
the Constitution inviolably, has induced a policy of intimate alliance
with the Romish priesthood. Passing events daily show that whatever
advantage the sacerdotal order of the (Roman) Catholics may be supposed
to derive from a State connection, that union deeply injures the
vitality of Protestantism. As stated in Louis Napoleon’s proclamation
promulgating his constitution, “It is still the <i lang="fr">Concordat</i> that regulates
the relations of the State with the Church.” The 20th article of the
Constitution makes the cardinals <i lang="la">ex officio</i> members of the senate.—<span class="smcap">Transl.</span></p>
